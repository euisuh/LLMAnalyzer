Describe the controversy surrounding Scott Pruitt's frequent first-class trips. Respond in 11 sentences.,,"Even conservatives are starting to ask questions about the mess at the EPA.
Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt is no stranger to controversy. But as the scandal outcry over his frequent first-class trips grows more intense, even congressional Republicans are starting to ask questions. On Tuesday, House oversight committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) sent the EPA administrator a letter requesting all documentation related to Pruitt’s work-related flights over the past year, including details about the cost, how many staff and security personnel traveled with him, and any waivers the agency issued that would permit first-class travel.
The information Gowdy requested could help clear up one pressing question—whether the EPA broke any rules when it shelled out money for Pruitt’s costly trips. An EPA spokesperson, Jahan Wilcox, originally told Politico that Pruitt had a “blanket waiver” for the expensive travel, citing concern for Pruitt’s security. But a blanket waiver would violate federal rules that require sign-off for first-class on a case-by-case basis, and the EPA later amended its story to say there was a waiver for each trip. “Clearly, federal regulations would prohibit a blanket waiver to fly first class except to accommodate disabilities or special needs,” wrote Gowdy, who recently announced that he’ll be retiring from Congress at the end of the year.
The documents, which Gowdy wants by March 6, would also shed light on issues such as the actual cost of Pruitt’s first-class flights and the size of the security detail that traveled with him. Unlike other recent administrators, Pruitt is accompanied by security at all times, even inside EPA headquarters. Some of those guards, moreover, reportedly come from the EPA’s enforcement office, which means that if they weren’t busy protecting Pruitt, their job would be to investigate environmental crimes around the country.",,akoksal/LongForm

""Fact1: qualities in him are instilled in him due to presence of corrupt politicians and Home Minister Bhavani Shankar, Fact2: brother is crime reporter for Indian Times, Fact3: Suraj asks DIG to ask Mayor 's wife to bring her to him, Fact4: Mayor 's wife brings girl to Bhavani Shankar, Fact5: Mayor and Arun head to police department to have Home Minister Bhavani Shankar Filled with arrested for this anger and disgust""",,"Assistant Commissioner of Police, Suraj Chauhan Govinda is an honest and diligent police officer. These qualities in him are instilled in him due to the presence of corrupt politicians and police officers like the Home Minister Bhavani Shankar Shakti Kapoor, Surajs Deputy Inspector General Kiran Kumar. Suraj has a brother Arun Chauhan, who is a crime reporter for the Indian Times. Home Minister Bhavani Shankar goes to a function held by an adoption center for orphan girls. There he encounters a pretty girl and instantly feels infatuated with her. He asks the DIG to ask the Mayors wife to bring her to him since the Mayors wife is the owner of the adoption center. At first, the Mayors wife resists and says no, but when the DIG threatens to tell the truth about her past endeavours about dealing with prostitutes to her husband, she agrees. That night, when the Mayors wife brings the girl to Bhavani Shankar, little does he know that Arun is on an assignment for his newspaper. Arun discovers and records a video of Bhavani Shankar raping the same girl from the adoption center. The next night, Arun goes to see the Mayor only to show him the misdeed that Home Minister Bhavani Shankar has committed. Filled with anger and disgust, the Mayor and Arun head to the police department to have Home Minister Bhavani Shankar arrested for this. But unfortunately, the Mayors wife overhears them and informs the DIG about this. On the way to the police station, Arun and the Mayor are blocked and then ruthlessly killed by Chakku Pande Puneet Issar, a special hired goon of Bhavani Shankar. Suraj is enraged and aggrieved at the loss of his brother and swears to avenge his death. As Suraj finally starts coming more in contact with Bhavani Shankar, he realizes his bad character and that Bhavani Shankar is the one behind his brothers killing. After that, Suraj goes to Chakku Pande to get him to confess the killing he did according to the order given by Bhavani Shankar. But Chakku Pande denies it and thus is beaten up by Suraj. Chakku Pande gets sent to jail by Suraj until he decides to confess to his crime. Then one night, Bhavani Shankar hires a few goons to have Chakku Pande killed. But Chakku Pande survives due to Suraj and the police and claims he will protest against Bhavani Shankar. To Surajs surprise, when he takes Chakku Pande to a huge public function to confess this truth, Chakku Pande puts the blame on Suraj. After that, the lights go out and a gunshot is heard. When the lights come back on, Chakku Pande is dead and a possible suspect is seen running away through the crowd by Suraj. Presuming that Suraj is the killer which he is not, the evil police officers of Bhavani Shankar arrest Suraj and send him to jail for the murder of Chakku Pande. But when he reaches jail, he is surprised to see that he has a lookalike, Rajnikant. Rajnikant is a simple man with strong positive morals who came to jail because he killed a man who tried to rape his wife. And when Rajnikant realizes that the evil politicians put Suraj in jail in the first place, he suggests that Suraj and Rajnikant can switch places so that Suraj can leave as Rajnikant, since Rajnikants sentence is almost over. And from here onwards, starts a fun and action filled story of how Suraj and Rajnikant join forces to finally accomplish Surajs goal of avenging his brother.",,akoksal/LongForm
Describe the changes to the ESPN Apple TV app.,,"The ESPN Apple TV app has undergone some key changes, including receiving a more familiar name. The moves come as the No. 1 sports network in the U.S. has seen its number of subscribers drop in recent months.
The WatchESPN app on Apple TV is now simply called ESPN. With the rebranding, the app now plays a live stream of one of the company’s networks at launch. This allows authenticated users to get into the action without taking additional steps.
The ESPN app also includes a new collection of curated on-demand videos from some of the channel’s most popular titles. This includes content from “30 for 30,” E:60,” “Outside the Lines,” “SC Featured,” and more.
Finally, the app has become more streamlined. For example, under the Featured content, you can find videos by Sports & Events or Channels.
In 2016, the number of ESPN subscribers dropped to 90 million from 92 million the year before. As a result, ad revenues fell 7 percent during the last three months of the year. In doing so it hopes to cut $100 million in salaries in the coming months.

"""Neural Reinforcement Learning: How is it applied to the Brain and Machine Learning?""",,"One of the most influential contributions of machine learning to understanding the human brain is the (fairly recent) formulation of learning in real world tasks in terms of the computational framework of reinforcement learning. This confluence of ideas is not limited to abstract ideas about how trial and error learning should proceed, but rather, current views regarding the computational roles of extremely important brain substances (such as dopamine) and brain areas (such as the basal ganglia) draw heavily from reinforcement learning. The results of this growing line of research stand to contribute not only to neuroscience and psychology, but also to machine learning: human and animal brains are remarkably adept at learning new tasks in an uncertain, dynamic and extremely complex world. Understanding how the brain implements reinforcement learning efficiently may suggest similar solutions to engineering and artificial intelligent problems. This tutorial will present the current state of the study of neural reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on both what it teaches us about the brain, and what it teaches us about reinforcement learning.
Target Audience: The target audience are researchers working in the field of reinforcement learning, who are interested in the current state-of-the-art of neuroscientific applications of this theoretical framework, as well as researchers working in related fields of machine learning such as engineering and robotics. Familiarity/basic knowledge of reinforcement learning (MDPs, dynamic programming, online temporal difference methods) will be assumed; basic knowledge in neuroscience or psychology will not.
Tutorial outline: Introduction: A coarse-grain overview of the brain and what we currently know about how it works Learning and decision making in animals and humans: is this really a reinforcement learning problem? Dopamine and prediction errors: what we know about dopamine, why we think it computes a temporal difference prediction error, and why should we care? Evidence for the prediction error hypothesis of dopamine Actor/Critic architectures in the basal ganglia: a distribution of functions in a learning network SARSA versus Q-learning: can dopamine reveal what algorithm the brain actually uses? Multiple learning systems in the brain: what is the evidence for both model based and model free reinforcement learning systems in the brain, why have more than one system, and how to arbitrate between them Beyond phasic dopamine: average reward reinforcement learning, tonic dopamine and the control of response vigor Risk and reinforcement learning: can the brain tell us something about learning of the variance of rewards? Open challenges and future directions: what more can reinforcement learning teach us about the brain, and where can we expect the brain to teach us about reinforcement learning?",,akoksal/LongForm
Describe the case of the seven individuals who sued President Trump for blocking users from seeing his tweets.,,"Blocking users from viewing his Twitter account is unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment, according to the judge.
Blocking users from viewing his Twitter account — a feature offered by the social media platform — is unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling.
""While we must recognize, and are sensitive to, the President’s personal First Amendment rights, he cannot exercise those rights in a way that infringes the corresponding First Amendment rights of those who have criticized him,"" Buchwald wrote.
The government had argued that blocked individuals could still access the president’s tweets. The judge agreed but said that even considering the president's First Amendment rights, preventing users from interacting directly with him on Twitter represented a violation of a ""real, albeit narrow, slice of speech.""
The case had been brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
It argued that the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account is a ""public forum"" under the First Amendment.
The institute represented seven individuals who had been blocked by account.
""We’re pleased with the court’s decision,"" said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute’s executive director. ""The president’s practice of blocking critics on Twitter is pernicious and unconstitutional, and we hope this ruling will bring it to an end.""
There was no immediate response to the ruling from the White House.
The lawsuit was filed last July against Trump and two of his aides, White House social media director Dan Scavino and then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer. It argued that Trump's account constituted a public forum under the First Amendment, and that the White House was violating the plaintiffs' First Amendment right to petition their government for redress of grievances.
The plaintiffs were: a university professor in Maryland, a surgery resident in Tennessee, a Washington state songwriter, a New York comedy writer, an author, a legal analyst and a police officer.
Trump, an avid Twitter user, frequently stokes controversy on social media.
In the past week, he has repeatedly claimed in multiple tweets that the Justice Department put a ""spy"" inside his presidential campaign to frame him for ""crimes he didn't commit"" amid mounting questions over his campaign's possible collusion with Russia.
The tweets prompted a reply from ex-FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump last year. Comey tweeted on Wednesday: ""Attacks on the FBI and lying about its work will do lasting damage to our country.""",,akoksal/LongForm

"Power requirements, and feasibility for a short high power bursts (very fast heating application)

I would like some help to evaluate the electrical feasibility of a system to heat 35 gram of thermoplastic material (for active stiffness control) in 50 ms, by about 100 degrees Celsius.
The material will be for example a thermoplastic polymer such as poly carbonate, or a composite. The idea is to have some sort of resistive wires integrated in the material for the heating process, similar as done in [1]. But please do not worry about the material part to much. 
From a rough calculation i get that the required energy is:
1200 [J/kg°C]*0.035 [kg]*100[°C]=4000[J]
to heat it in 50 ms, the power required would be approximately:
4000[J]/0.050[s]=80 000 W or 80kW.
At this point i would like to know if this is roughly feasible or not from an power and current point of view with a battery set or supper capacitors of a ""typical"" electric car? What type of Power Draws for short peaks are feasible with capacitors, and batteries which are typically available in electric cars?
What is the approximate range? Do i need to go down a factor of 10, or can i go up a factor of 10?

Multiple capacitors in parallel, which is what it will take to get to 3 F anyway, helps with this.
However, there is going to be a lot of loss delivering that energy to a load, especially since it isn't ""conductive"".  Its not clear whether you mean it's not electrically or not thermally conductive, but either way, it makes this problem difficult.  If you do this electrically, you will need to store several times the energy ultimately delivered to the object.
Heating the object chemically might be easier.  For example, a carefully calibrated layer of black powder should be able to deliver the energy in the short time you specify.  There are probably much better chemical reactants than black powder.  I'm just using that as a example.",,akoksal/LongForm
"""Background Paragraph: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp.

This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance.

Respond in detail. What does the '822 patent entail?,,"The ’822 patent adds nothing remotely inventive or technological to the basic idea of providing a portion of a periodical—i.e., a newspaper—based on the amount of space available. The patent owner, Nuglif, makes an application for distributing news and media content.
For the limits of the patent, we look to its claims, which define the applicant’s legal rights instead of describing the operation of the “invention” to which the claims supposedly correspond. The patent has only one independent claim, which includes steps of (a) receiving a pre-generated file linking to at least some content from current and upcoming digital editions, (b) requesting the linked-content for display, and (c) determining how much content from the upcoming edition to download based on publication date and device capacity.
Notably, the patent does not claim as the invention the processor, the network, the digital edition, the software application for reading the digital edition on the device, or any other technical aspect. Instead, it claims the combination of receiving, requesting, and determining, without limiting it to any particular device or manner of operation. Aside from the reference to a “processor-implemented” method in the preamble to the claim, nothing in the claim indicates these steps would even have to be performed by machinery rather than a human. Nor does it indicate why providing a partial edition would be challenging once a complete edition can be provided.
In 2014, the Supreme Court’s Alice v. CLS Bank decision confirmed what numerous earlier decisions had already established: to be eligible for a patent, an applicant must actually invent something. Patents on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and naturally-occurring phenomena are prohibited. These represent the fundamental building blocks of innovation and scientific progress that must remain available to the public. When a patent claims something in these prohibited categories and adds nothing to transform the claims into a specific invention, the patent takes from the public domain, and adds nothing in return.
Abstract ideas are basic principles that apply and often represent methods of organizing human activity that people have known and used for years without technological intervention. Too often, applicants obtain patents on abstract ideas by claiming systems or methods that merely apply these ideas using off-the-shelf computer hardware and software and without adding anything that is inventive and patent-eligible—i.e., something attributable to the applicant other than the abstract idea or pre-existing computer technology that supposedly makes it concrete.
The ’822 patent issued on August 7, 2018, and has a priority date of January 10, 2014. That means the Alice decision came out in plenty of time to block its issuance. The idea of providing less based on resource constraints is not even technological, let alone innovative. It is a basic idea that drives human activity every day: from our decision not to consume an entire day’s worth of food at breakfast, to our decision to fill our bag with only what we can carry, and actually need, for work or school.
Nothing in the patent suggests that the applicant came up with anything beyond the idea of making a determination based on timing and capacity. Even the patent relies on the obvious analog analogies, explaining that Saturday editions are typically “more voluminous” and thus demand more capacity than “lighter” Sunday editions with fewer sections. But that was just as true for paper editions distributed by newspaper carriers as for digital editions distributed on devices today. The need to adapt to the constraints of a medium is not a problem tied to any particular technological tool or environment.
Right now, we have no concerns about the conduct of the assignee, Nuglif. But we are worried that the Patent Office is still issuing patents like this one. Because the ’822 patent issued so recently, it has the potential to be used to threaten or bring suit until it expires in 2034. Since it directly relates to the distribution of news content, these threats could add to risks and costs of creating and distributing newspapers, magazines, and other creative content—activities the First Amendment protects.",,akoksal/LongForm

""Paragraph: Most people know roughly what a bottle of vitamin D supplements might cost them, so the lack of information on cost is not a significant gap. We appreciate that the story provided data showing the large and growing amount our society is spending on vitamin D supplements ($430 million in 2009), with apparently little health benefit to show for it. The story was mostly concerned with discussing the lack of benefit from taking extra vitamin D and calcium. And in this area it excels. While the story does lack precision when it suggests that adolescent girls should be getting more calcium (it never specifies how much they are getting now, how much more they’d need to meet the recommendations, or what benefits they might expect from this increased intake), it would be difficult for a journalist to come up with any sort of quantifiable benefit or harm estimate from the IOM report. The story captured the overall gist of the problem, which is that the evidence base is complex and still inadequate. The story notes that, contrary to the claims of many advocates for increased supplemental vitamin D, there is evidence that high levels of vitamin D may have adverse effects, such as increased risk for fractures and an increase in the overall death rate. The story also explained that too much calcium has been linked to increased risk of kidney stones and, more tentatively, heart disease. The story did a good job of describing how the expert committee conducted its review and what evidence they found. Importantly, it noted that  claims of benefit from extra vitamin D are based on observational studies that most scientists agree “cannot determine cause and effect.” We also like that the story solicited opinions from a variety of experts with no obvious stake in the controversy. This produced a number of quotes that emphasized the need for restraint when interpreting the research on vitamin D. Examples: “I think this report will make people more cautious” and “The onus is on the people who propose extra calcium and vitamin D to show it is safe before they push it on people.” Although we agree with the story’s skeptical overall message, we think it may have slammed the door just a bit too hard on the possibility of benefit from supplemental vitamin D. While claims of benefit may not be supported by the currently available evidence, they have not been conclusively disproved in randomized controlled studies, either. In fact, research is now underway to determine whether the benefits found in observational studies of vitamin D can be replicated in more rigorously designed trials. The story probably should have mentioned this research, and left the door to potential benefits open just a crack. No disease-mongering here. The diversity of independent voices included in this story is a real strength. Although it solicits the obligatory comment from a supplement industry spokesman, it didn’t go out of its way to find any of the more widely known vitamin D experts, some of whom have been issuing recommendations that are untenable based on current evidence. The enthusiasm of some of these researchers might be explained by their significant career and financial interests in promoting vitamin D. Not applicable for this story. The approaches discussed are not new, and there’s not really any alternative to getting adequate amounts of these essential nutrients. The availability of vitamin D from diet, sunlight and supplements is clear from the story. The novelty of vitamin D and calcium is not really in question, so we’ll call this not applicable. This story was not based on a news release. Claim: Report Questions Need for 2 Diet Supplements""",,"In one particularly effective passage, the story quoted a representative of a supplement industry group who disagreed with the report, saying that higher levels of vitamin D could be beneficial. But it then segued immediately into an explanation of why claims from supplementation advocates “are not supported by the available evidence.” The key problem, as the story points out, is that these claims are based almost exclusively on observational studies that can’t prove cause and effect and are often skewed by factors the researchers haven’t accounted for. Proponents of supplementation also have tended to downplay the possibility that higher doses of vitamin D and calcium might cause harm–a stance which the story notes may not be justified. We applaud this story’s effort to show readers where the weight of the evidence lies on this issue. Vitamin D is the latest in a long line of “miracle” nutrients that people have turned to in the hope of improving their health. As we’ve learned from copious previous experience, these supplements rarely work as advertised and can sometimes cause harm at the higher doses people often think will be beneficial for them. More isn’t necessarily better when it comes to vitamin D–or most other health care interventions for that matter.",,akoksal/LongForm

This street is on your beat, isn’t it?’ ‘Yes. I heard the shot when I was in Smith’s cigar store. It took me a while to locate it. The door was locked and I had to break in.’ As they walked into an inner office, they saw Gifford’s body, a bullet through the heart, lying in a pool of blood. Fordney stooped to pick up a revolver. ‘It’s an easy jump to the ground,’ observed the policeman, who was standing by an open window. ‘Did you know, sir,’ he added, ‘that Gifford has been troubled lately by blackmailers?’ ‘Yes. The last time I saw him, he told me he had been shot at a couple of weeks ago.’ Fordney walked over to the door and found the lock was sprung, but the key still in it. ‘I suppose,’ ventured the policeman, ‘that the blackmailers got him. They must have locked the door from the inside when they entered, shot him, and then jumped out the window.’ ‘No,’ said Fordney, who was examining the key he had removed from the lock. ‘There weren’t any murderers in here. Gifford committed suicide.’ Why was the Professor sure that it was suicide?",,"Gifford could not have been shot at the time he called Fordney, as he was found with a bullet through his heart.

I'm looking for a comprehensive guide on how to decline a phone call with a text message. Can you provide 9 detailed steps?,,"1. Know your options when a call comes in.: When you receive an incoming call, a circle appears on the incoming call screen. Look closely at the options available surrounding that circle, and you’ll see that you need not be flustered.

Normally, to answer a call, you would slide the circle to the right side of the screen, and to reject the call, you would slide the circle to the left side of the screen.
The other option available is to decline the call with a text message.
2. Drag the circle to the messaging icon and let go.: When you can’t take a call, dragging the circle to the messaging icon and letting go will let you send a quick text message, which can either be pre-written or created on the spot.
3. Select an appropriate reply from the pre-written messages.: You can also choose the “Custom” option to create a text message (that is, when none of the pre-written messages will do).

Your selection of a pre-written text message will automatically decline the incoming call by sending the text message to the caller.
Creating custom messages and clicking on the Send button will also decline the call.
4. Open the Phone application from your apps menu.: The Phone app can be found in your App Drawer and is represented by a phone icon.
5. Tap on the Menu button.: It’s the button represented by three horizontal bars, and found at the bottom right or bottom left corner of the phone screen.
6. Tap on Call Settings.: You should be able to find it under Settings. In some Android devices, Call Settings can also be categorized under “Other Settings.”
7. Select the Quick Responses option.: Here, you will find the list of pre-written short messages.
8. Select the message you wish to edit.: Edit the selected text message according to your preferences. You can include a greeting at the start of the message if you wish, just to make the message sound a bit more friendly.
9. Save the edited message.: Simply click on “OK” or “Done” to save the edited pre-written text message.

"Story: Ernestine “Mama” McCormick was one day shy of her 100th birthday. Tomorrow, Michael, Connie and her two grandchildren would celebrate. But, that was tomorrow. Now, she had other things on her mind. It was a few minutes before midnight and the familiar sounds coming from the downstairs den were especially loud. Ernestine was a strong, spiritual person and she felt the presence of her deceased husband’s spirit within the large house. She was convinced that it was Mike who visited the den every night after she retired to her bed. Hidden within a false wall in their home were rare and valuable gold coins -- coins that Mike had obtained in Africa shortly after the war. Mike had cherished the coins, and Ernestine sensed, or thought she sensed, that Mike was struggling to obtain them. She feared setting the coins out for him, lest he leave with them and not return. How a ghost would do this, she did not know. But his absence was something she dreaded. Every morning, Ernestine would survey the den. Sometimes, she could tell the room had been disturbed. Ernestine would not allow the maid to dust the den for this reason. One morning she had noticed the dust collecting on the gas cutoff feeding the fireplace. Near it, several magazines on the large coffee table had been strewn about the richly finished wood floor. Ernestine suspected the cause to be strong drafts drawn by the huge fireplace – or was it indeed Mike’s ghost thrashing about in frustration? Ernestine kept the “gas key,” which was the key to the disguised den wall safe, hanging on the wall upstairs. She learned long ago that Mike’s spirit would not come upstairs – or anywhere near her. Ernestine took the presence of Mike’s spirit seriously. The family mansion, which had been constructed in the late 1950s, still had the old-fashioned light switches it was originally built with. She kept these because of the loud click they made when flipped on or off. As far as she could recall, she had never heard a light switch go on or off in the middle of the night. She also refused to change the arrangement of furniture or the placement of pictures on the mansion’s many walls. In her mind, if it was Mike, she wanted him to feel at home. But nearing 100, Ernestine knew her senses could not be all that trustworthy. She asked herself often: Is Mike truly with me, or is it an old lady’s wishful thinking? All of this ran through Ernestine’s mind as she lay silently in bed. The next day, Michael and Connie were the first to arrive in the middle of the morning. Their children, Casey and Ellen, arrived early in the afternoon. The McCormick family was not just any family. The late Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. Michael, Jr. and his brothers held key posts with the corporation. By the middle of the afternoon, Mama Ernestine, as she was called, was holding court in the dining room. A light lunch was being catered and she was up for the occasion. She was in excellent health physically and had lost none of her formidable mental faculties. As the family sat around the table, she silently took stock of those she loved dearly. Sadly, she reflected that her 65-year-old son, Michael, appeared to be in poor health. Michael was at least 40 pounds overweight and in the early stages of emphysema, caused by many years of smoking. He was chronically nearsighted and wore glasses so thick the lenses appeared to be coke bottle bottoms. As if reading his mother’s mind, he said, “I can see OK with the glasses, but cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with them on. I don’t know what we would do without our driver.” Ernestine smiled and kept her concerns to herself. She asked daughter-in-law, Connie, how she was doing. Connie had suffered polio in the 1950s epidemic and one leg was shorter than the other. She walked unevenly and with the help of a cane an elevated shoe. Connie replied, “I’m getting along OK, but the doc tells me to wear hard soled and heeled shoes at all times to avoid bone spurs.” Connie laughed, “This big shoe feels like a bowling ball sometimes but I’m not complaining. At least I can get around.” Ernestine nodded. Connie’s ability to laugh at herself was something she admired very much. She turned to Casey, her 36-year-old grandson. Casey was the free spirit in the family and it showed today. Casey had arrived at the McCormick house wearing a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers and heavy soled boots. He had a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. That was all he brought with him. Ernestine teased him, “Are you a Rambo wannabe?” The good natured Casey grinned back at her and said, “I suppose so.” Next, Ernestine surveyed Ellen. Ellen was 29 and an accomplished ballet dancer. Ernestine figured there was no way she could weigh more than 90 pounds. Ernestine considered that she would have made an excellent spy or cat burglar. She was able to appear and disappear unnoticed, so graceful and quiet were her body movements. She asked Ellen, “How is the dancing going?” “It’s going great, Mama. I’ve been able to raise several thousand dollars for the McCormick Foundation since last time I saw you.” Ernestine was fiercely proud of her granddaughter. She motioned for her to come closer. She kissed Ellen on the cheek and said, “Dear, I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work.” The family had a wonderful visit over the late lunch. A light dinner and birthday cake would be enjoyed later. Before retiring for an afternoon nap, Ernestine decided it was time to tell them of her suspicions concerning their grandfather’s ghost. “Now, all of you will think this is the rambling of an old lady. Maybe it is, but hear me out. You’ve heard me speak of your grandfather’s African coins. We even showed them to you once when you younger ones were kids. Well, they are not in a safety deposit box like we told you – they are in a hidden safe in the den. The keyhole for the fireplace gas valve in the den is really the lock to the safe. That’s where the coins are. Several times a week … most nights, really, I hear noises down there, as if your grandfather is trying to get to the safe. Everyone was polite enough not to scoff at Mama Ernestine’s story. That night, they enjoyed Mama’s party. Everyone was in bed by 11:00 p.m. Sure enough, around 2:00 a.m., Ernestine heard noises in the night, only this time they were different. She heard the faint creaking of a door and felt the quiet and steady -- but heavy -- footsteps on the hardwood floors. She thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal downstairs. Ernestine didn’t know what to think and did not sleep the remainder of the night. In the morning, upon inspection of the den and wall safe, her fears were confirmed. Sitting on the sofa and pondering the situation for a few minutes, she realized what had happened: Someone had stolen the gold coins. With great agitation, she called the family together before breakfast. She held her temper long enough to explain what happened and, showing them the empty wall safe, said, “I know who did this.” Pointing to the guilty person, she said, heatedly, “Shame on you! Why did you do this?” Who stole the gold coins?",,"The family members were not quite certain whom she was pointing her shaking finger at. As if reading their minds, she said, “I’m sensing that your grandfather is with us.”

Ellen respectfully asked, “Do you really believe that Papa McCormick took the coins?”

Ernestine controlled her fury for the sake of her favorite granddaughter. She took a few deep breaths and began to speak, “No, I don’t, dear, but I know who did. She asked, “Casey, why in the world did you steal your grandfather’s coins?”

Casey asked, feebly, “What makes you think I have them?”

Ernestine answered, “I may be old but I notice things. Last night, I heard footsteps, doors opening and a faint metallic sound. This morning I checked and, sure enough, somebody took the key and opened the safe in the middle of the night.”

Patiently, Casey asked again, “So, why do you think I did it”

Quietly, Ernestine answered, “It’s simple, really. Your father cannot see in the dark. I know that whoever was moving around in the night did not turn on any lights because I did not hear any switches being flipped. It wasn’t your mother because she would have had too much difficulty and made too much noise, especially going downstairs in the dark. Your sister would be just the opposite. She is too quiet and graceful to have done it. If she wanted to sneak around this house, nobody would have heard anything. Now Casey, you had a situation where luck met opportunity.”

Evenly, Casey replied, “OK, it was me, but I wasn’t stealing them, Mama.” Wryly, he said, “You and Papa Mike have made sure we do not need to steal anything from anybody. I simply wished to have them cleaned and presented to you as a surprise.”

Ernestine believed him and her attitude softened. Casey saw this and playfully asked, “What makes you think it was not Papa’s ghost?”

Ernestine took a deep breath. Sadly, she said, “I don’t know if I really believe in ghosts.” Sighing, she added, “I simply don’t know. It’s just so comforting to think he is here with me.” Mama paused for a moment to think about what she was saying, and then continued, “Besides, even if he were here, he doesn’t come upstairs. You have to have the key to open the safe.” Ernestine paused once again before adding, “Sweetie, what gave you away was that you just made a little bit too much noise for it to be Papa’s ghost. … That and your heavy footsteps in those army boots.”

Everyone laughed at this. Grinning, Casey said, “Everyone come upstairs and I will give Mama back the coins. They are on my bed. I was going to stuff them in my pockets just before leaving.” Casey paused, and then asked, “Would you like for me to have them cleaned? I realize now I should have asked.”

Smiling now, Mama replied, “No, but thanks for the thought. I prefer to leave things the way Papa left them.”

Upon arriving in Casey’s bedroom, they all saw that there were no coins on the bed. Instead, an old business card of Mike’s was found on Casey’s pillow -- one that Ernestine had not seen in many years. Casey looked ill but Ernestine knew exactly what happened and all doubts concerning her husband’s spirit were erased. Excitedly, she said, “Mike’s been here. He came up and got them when we were all downstairs. I believe he will be at peace now, but I hope he will stay around.”

Just then, a gentle gust of cool, refreshing air swept into the room. They all felt it. Mama said, with emotion wracking her ancient voice, “Yes, he’s still here. He’s broken his rule to remain upstairs to be near us.”",,akoksal/LongForm

Describe the partnership between Earth Twine and Stratis.,,"Earth Twine partners with Stratis!
As seafood industry professionals, the EARTH TWINE team has created a solution born of the industry itself. In collaboration with The Association of International Seafood Professionals (AISP), Earth Twine has established the means for inclusive representation of all sectors of seafood professionals. Earth Twine’s comprehensive understanding of the unique seafood supply chain, and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR’s) has led to the development of its solution that provides a product for all stakeholders of the supply chain, small and large.
SPARKL enables our multiple tracking applications and systems to work collaboratively within legacy environments. This fuels the platform to orchestrate multiple structures and will reduce complexities in the seafood supply chain.
Stratis will establish distinct, dedicated blockchains, tokens and applications to integrate Earth Twine’s global seafood tracking solution onto the blockchain. This rapid innovation and development will transform the seafood industry by introducing unprecedented levels of trust, collaboration and settlement, in turn, increasing productivity and sustainability.
Starting January 2018, the Seafood Import Monitoring Program requires specific data related to seafood imports to be provided electronically to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. For many years, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and/or misrepresented seafood have affected global seafood markets. The Earth Twine-Stratis Platform will significantly help solve the NOAA Compliance Standards (who, what, when, where) that will confirm and validate the information as proof positive.
A fundamental partnership for Earth Twine is Greenberg Traurig Law, the largest law firm in the USA. The Earth Twine team benefits from Greenberg Traurig Law’s international presence, industry specific knowledge of blockchain innovation, and its evolution and emerging regulations around cryptocurrencies by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",,akoksal/LongForm

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest. gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8. The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals). The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers. curtailment rules (gas): More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order: interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.

"Search for special characters like “!” in Gmail subject

Does anyone know if in Gmail you can search all messages that have an exclamation mark in the subject?
I would like to create a filter that adds a red ! label to the messages that have an exclamation mark in the subject. But searching for subject:! results in all messages. I've tried things like /!/, /\!/, (/\!/), ""!"", but all these searches just give me all messages, not just those with ! in the subject.

From the ""About Gmail Search"" documentation:

Gmail doesn't recognize special search characters like square brackets, parentheses, currency symbols, the ampersand, the pound sign, and asterisks.

As you appear to have already discovered, and my quick tests appear to confirm, this seems to include the exclamation mark character.
I would assume that the regular expression Google are using to match search queries with possible results simply excludes all special characters and operates only on ""word characters"" (you can somewhat confirm this by the fact that searches for the underscore character, _, do work - the underscore is treated as a word character in a regular expression).",,"With the help of Google Apps Script, you can use regular expressions in Gmail to find messages that have the exclamation mark in the subject.

"What is the best way to free your queen as soon as possible?

We can open games in many ways (any of the pawns or knights) and then go ahead with different strategies.

Which types of opening and/or moves would facilitate this? Also provide any pros and cons to your strategy.

A:

I don't think that getting your queen out early should be your goal in the opening.  Fighting for the center, developing your pieces, and king safety should be your priority.  That said, e-pawn openings are your best bet to open lines for your queen as soon as possible.  Look into the Ruy Lopez:
[FEN """"]
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5 ...

A:

Bringing out the queen in the opening is in general not the correct decision. The point is that usually the other side will often be able to develop their pieces to attack the queen and gain tempi.
However, if you still feel inclined to bring out the queen early, the only opening with a sound reputation I can recommend is the Scandinavian (1. e4 d5) as black, and after the usual 2. exd5 Qxd5 your queen is out.

 Domoic acid is naturally occurring toxin that can't be cleaned or cooked away 
  
 Domoic acid poisoning causes dizziness, vomiting, and in severe cases, death 
  
 (CNN) Put down the California crab legs -- they could be poisonous. 
  
 ""Due to the detection of dangerous levels of domoic acid,"" Dungeness and rock crabs caught in waters between the Oregon borders and the southern Santa Barbara County line pose a ""significant risk to the public if consumed,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a release.

 Domoic acid is a naturally occurring toxin produced from ""some species of the marine diatom Pseudo-nitzschia,"" the state Department of Fish and Wildlife said. 
  
 A massive bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia, brought by warmer water temperatures associated with the El Nino event, is causing high levels of the acid. 
  
 Marine animals, such as crabs, that filter their food through seawater may accumulate the toxins. While the toxins, which are colorless and odorless, don't seem to harm the animals accumulating them, people who eat the animals may become poisoned.

 Do not — repeat, not — eat crab caught along much of the California coast until further notice. That’s the stunning message issued Tuesday by health officials just days before Saturday’s start of the recreational crab season, which may be delayed. 
  
 The California Department of Public Health is warning that potentially deadly levels of domoic acid have been found in Dungeness crab and rock crab caught along the coastline between Oregon and the southern border of Santa Barbara County. As a result, the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment is recommending the Dungeness season be delayed and the rock crab fishery be closed.

 The Fish and Game Commission will hold an emergency public meeting at 8 a.m. Thursday in Sacramento, to be live-streamed on Cal-Span. 
  
 “Delaying or closing the season is disappointing,” said Craig Shuman, marine regional manager of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, which sets the dates for the season. “But public health and safety is our top priority.” 
  
 On the mild side, toxic crabs can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and headache, according to public health officials who say the symptoms can persist for days. 
  
 But severe poisoning can kill a victim, officials report. Short of that, the poisoning can also lead to permanent short-term memory loss, coma, seizures and other symptoms. 
  
 The 600-boat commercial crabbing season is scheduled to begin Nov. 15, and crabbers have been pouring into the Bay Area from Alaska, Oregon and Washington hoping to earn half their annual income. And Bay Area restaurants — and customers — expect crabbers to provide tons of crustaceans for the menus. 
  
 “It’s going to be devastating” for the crabbers whose livelihood depends on this crucial time of the year, said Mike Dvorak, captain of the High Seas, a vessel big enough to collect 20,000 pounds of varied seafood in a single haul. Crabbers gross about $60 million a year. Halting the crab season would have a lesser impact on boat owners, he said. 
  
 “Those who aren’t boat owners will say it’s a disaster,” he said. “They won’t know what to tell their families.” 
  
 Chefs like Gordon Drysdale at Scoma’s on San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf say they go through 40 to 60 Dungeness crabs a day. And during the holidays, they go through about 100 daily. 
  
 “It’s a big deal for us. We’re all kind of anxious,” Drysdale said. At the same time, restaurants can get high-quality crab from elsewhere, he said. “We’ve had to have crab on the menu every day for 50 years, so everyone’s pretty resourceful.” 
  
 Boat owners believe this summer’s warmer coastal water — 60-plus degrees on average, instead of the typical 54 degrees — is behind the toxic bloom. 
  
 Health officials say symptoms of poisoning can appear up to 24 hours after someone has eaten toxic seafood, though no illnesses have been reported. 
  
 Domoic acid is a naturally occurring toxin related to the rise of a tiny plant called pseudo-nitzschia. Officials say they aren’t sure why the plant has bloomed and tainted the crabs — and they don’t know when it will subside. 
  
 “The health advisory will be lifted once the levels are no longer above acceptable levels,” they said.

Mild symptoms of eating the tainted crabs include vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches, the Chronicle reports. The severe symptoms are permanent memory loss, seizures, and death.

Describe Mavericks Big Wave Surf Contest.,,"A beast of a thing off the coast of Northern California, the wave started when a storm near Alaska raged long enough and strong enough to send its energy barreling over two thousand miles of open ocean. That energy hit the continental shelf about 80 miles offshore and continued full force until it slammed into a shallow reef a mile from Half Moon Bay. From there, the underwater topography focused the energy and forced the water to stand up into a 40- or 50-foot wave.
Clark, a board shaper who owns Mavericks Surf Company, still rides the wave. But these days, he also invites 24 watermen from all over the world to compete on one of the world's most famous waves in the Titans of Mavericks, a famed big-wave surf that's equal parts prestige and peril. This year’s event begins Friday, February 12.
As the contest kicks off, here’s everything you need to know about its history, the competitors, judging, and where to watch.
In the early 1990s, big wave riders from Hawaii and Australia started arriving in Half Moon Bay to test their mettle on the beastly break. Only the best of the best tried it; sadly, and maybe not surprisingly, not all of them made it out alive. In 1994, a well-respected Hawaiian named Mark Foo drowned in his first session at Mavericks. Newspapers all over the world reported his death and described the perils of this “newly discovered” spot.
By 1999, Clark was ready to organize the first contest on the wave. Virostok won the first event, and then repeated the feat in 2000 and 2004, before joining Clark on the Committee 5, the contest’s governing body.
And even in the years when the contest isn't called (more on that below), the monster wave still flexes its muscles. In 2011, a non-contest year, big-wave surfer Sion Milosky, died after a wipeout at Mavericks. In a Mavericks practice session in January 2016, Garrett McNamara, another well-known pro, had a nasty spill that landed him in the hospital for emergency surgery. Waves at that time were up to 50 feet.
The Committee 5, also called C5, makes all the contest's big decisions, like who judges and who gets to compete. To determine the roster, the C5 looks for dedication to the wave. All five committee members are big-wave surfers and have done their time in the cold water off Point Pillar. Mavericks doesn’t really get cranking until January, so the committee members keep an eye on the field of potential picks during the pre-season in the fall. They note who’s catching the biggest waves, who understands the inherent danger, and who knows the rules of water safety. The committee picks 22 surfers and names 10 alternates from which to fill the final two spots.
To give you a sense of how Titanesque surfers need to be to get the invite, McNamara, who surfed the record-breaking 100-foot wave in Portugal two years ago, only made the alternate list last year.
The full field includes plenty of Bay Area locals, as well as surfers from Australia, Brazil, Hawaii, and South Africa.
The C5 also decides when Mavericks begins. Unlike a football game, which can be scheduled months or years in advance, a surf contest can only happen when the weather and water collaborate. In the 16 years since its creation, this will be only the 10th contest of Mavericks. Some years, like in 2015, the ocean refuses to cooperate.
The C5 enlisted professional surfcasters who track the storms near Alaska, compare them to old-school weather charts, readings from buoys 700 miles off the coast of California, and new weather data from NASA’s Jason-2 satellite.
When all conditions are met, the Committee sends an alert to the athletes who have 48 hours to arrive on site. Once the contest begins Friday at 7:30 am, surfers will compete in heat after heat, until only two remain. The winner and runner-up will be awarded the $120,000 prize.
The area closest to the contest, Princeton by the Sea, will be closed off to spectators due to environmental and safety concerns. In 2010, when spectators could stand on the seawall, a pair of rogue waves crashed into them and sent dozens of people scurrying and three to the hospital.

That emergence of disruptive technologies, such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence and virtual reality is priming the IT world for a massive boom. It is also driving the increasing demand for talented and knowledgeable coders.
However, that demand is exposing flaws in talent pools, creating situations where the ill-equipped are attempting to take on projects, which will ultimately fail. Simply put, more and more businesses are turning to talent pools consisting of contractual programmers, data scientists and other IT professionals, and it is becoming more difficult to find and retain qualified professionals who can get the job done.
One of the biggest challenges with using talent pools comes in the form of setting expectations and goals, two elements that are often open to interpretation and can ultimately derail a project if not addressed properly.
Instituting governance proves to be one of the best ways to deal with those issues. However, most of the governance solutions used today lack flexibility and are built on closed systems, making it difficult for contractors and clients to come together to develop a smooth flowing process that results in success.
Perhaps the answer to that dilemma lies with an open source ideology, one where a level playing field is established, flexibility instituted and fully auditable tasks are recorded. In other words, a decentralization platform built upon blockchain technology, where data is stored across multiple networks and every entry is both transparent and immutable.
Blockchain has the potential to change the project orchestration process. Take, for example, a situation where a rapidly approaching project due date is threatened by a coding or development problem.
Most managers will attempt to locate alternatives or specific expertise to get things back on track, forcing them to turn to external solutions. Locating those resources and expediting the process often creates additional challenges, situations where talent pools become a viable path. However, picking the right talent entails vetting the talent, managing the talent and making the appropriate arrangements.
Dealing with that talent can be tricky as well. There are many cases where contractors feel frustrated to continually be providing solutions that are company-changing, and only receive a pat on the back from management. Fantastic IT professionals often find themselves pigeon-holed into narrow scope positions, unable to really use their skills, and benefit from what they produce. The fundamental problem behind that situation comes in the form of support and orchestration.
One startup, FundRequest, is aiming to bring a blockchain-based platform to fruition to solve the many problems of securing and managing talent. The FundRequest platform was created to ensure that IT professionals can receive compensation for work, while also allowing users and companies to provide additional incentives to keep IT professionals engaged in the development process, where they can continue to fix issues, deal with bugs,or design specific features.
FundRequest leverages the ideology of a decentralization platform, which allows participants to post projects and select which professionals are allowed to contribute. By decentralizing access to projects and professionals, FundRequest has epitomized the true nature of peer-to-peer (P2P) open source programming. Those capabilities bode well for businesses looking to leverage Open Source projects by allowing them to engage with the community and compensate those that offer value.
IT professionals are in absolute control of their contributions and the tasks they choose to address. Contributors are able to select the jobs that best meet their needs, and at the same time, offer high level solutions to companies without requiring the company to hire a full-time employee.
For project managers, the platform provides a mechanism to reach out and find support for open source coding that is far better and more cost effective than current open source support, eliminating the need for purchasing an expensive support package, while still being able to make tailored requests so that tasks are fulfilled with precision.
Blockchain technology brings additional benefits to the process, where funds for project payments are escrowed using a smart contract, protecting parties until the job is complete.
The use cases for blockchain are ever-evolving, bringing opportunity and innovation to the market, where real-time performance and disruptive technologies have come to give businesses a competitive edge.",,akoksal/LongForm
Write a brief summary about David Koch's resignation from Koch Industries and the political network.,,"David Koch, a billionaire famous for his conservative politics, resigned from Koch Industries and the political network he helped build.
WASHINGTON – Conservative billionaire David Koch is stepping down from a key role in the political and policy empire that made him and his older brother two of the most powerful men in American politics and among the most vilified figures in Democratic circles.
Koch, 78, is leaving the board of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, Koch officials announced Tuesday. He also is retiring from his roles at Koch Industries, the Kansas-based conglomerate run by his brother Charles. David Koch served as executive vice president of the company and a member of its board. He was chairman and CEO of one its subsidiaries, Koch Chemical Technology Group.
Koch officials cited health reasons for the departure but declined to provide details on the nature of his illness. David Koch is a prostate cancer survivor and donated hundreds of millions of dollars to cancer research and medical facilities over the years.
In a letter sent Tuesday morning to Koch Industries' employees, Charles Koch said his brother first announced his ""declining health"" in October 2016.
""Unfortunately, these issues have not been resolved, and his health has continued to deteriorate,"" Charles Koch wrote. ""As a result, he is unable to be involved in business and other organizational activities.
""His guidance and loyalty, especially in our most troubling times, has been unwavering,"" Charles Koch wrote. He said David Koch would be named a director emeritus of the company.
Charles Koch, 82, remains at the helm of the family’s oil, chemical and textile conglomerate. Koch Industries is the country’s second-largest private company after Cargill and makes everything from components in iPhones to Brawny paper towels. The company made the brothers among the planet’s richest men. Forbes estimates they are worth $60 billion each.
They are best known for their role in politics and using their fortune to inject millions into an array of foundations, think tanks and political groups to spread their small-government, free-market messages.
Americans for Prosperity has operations in 36 states and a standing army of about 3 million activists the Kochs mobilize for political and policy battles.
The network, which includes about 700 like-minded donors who commit to giving at least $100,000 a year, plans to spend $400 million in policy and politics before the 2018 elections, the group’s largest midterm investment. Big-name Republican politicians seek their support in elections and policy fights. Last fall, Vice President Pence traveled to New York to rally David Koch and a group of about 100 other donors to back a Republican tax-cut plan.
The Koch groups committed to plowing about $20 million into efforts to pass the successful $1.5 trillion tax overhaul and sell it to voters before November's midterm elections.
David Koch made his own foray into politics decades ago, waging an unsuccessful bid as the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential candidate in 1980 with Ed Clark. They won about 1% of the vote.
Charles Koch stands at the center of their political world, presiding over twice-yearly retreats with the network’s top donors. Two of his lieutenants — Koch Industries’ lead attorney Mark Holden and Brian Hooks, who runs the Charles Koch Foundation — have taken higher-profile roles in guiding the network’s activities in recent years.
In a statement Tuesday about Koch's departure, Holden said network officials ""greatly appreciate his vital role on the board and all that he has done to help us build a strong foundation for our future success.""
While Charles Koch has remained in the family’s hometown of Wichita, David Koch is a prominent figure in New York, where he has been a big contributor to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a leading arts patron. Koch officials said David Koch's donations and pledges to non-profit groups have topped $1.3 billion.
His pledge in 2008 to donate $100 million prompted Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts to rename the dance-focused New York State Theater in his honor.
He's donated to museums — giving $35 million to the Smithsonian's Natural History Museum and $20 million to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Those gifts triggered some controversy. More than 100 scientists petitioned natural history museums to sever ties with Koch and any other executives in the fossil fuels industry.
Democrats criticized the brothers for their outsize role in American politics.
President Obama targeted them in the first ad of his 2012 re-election campaign. When Harry Reid was Senate majority leader, the Nevada Democrat routinely railed against the duo in the run-up to the 2014 midterm elections as “power-drunk billionaires” intent on buying American elections to suit their purposes.
That year, the publicity-averse family began a television advertising campaign to defend their business brand and have since opened up portions of their donor retreats to reporters.",,akoksal/LongForm

My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell-cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells. Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells. Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin-binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells. On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I’m going to report on the FEBS-EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september.

Could you outline 11 practical steps to achieve choose a halloween costume?,,"With Halloween coming up, if you haven't already chosen a costume, it's possible you're stuck for ideas. Never fear, there are plenty of ways to come up with creative, original ideas for a costume and still keep within a budget. Rest assured that this article will help you to pick the perfect Halloween costume for you.
1. Find your own style.: Are you sexy? Scary? Funny? Cute? Perky? Angry? Halloween is the time of year where you can be yourself! So in that case, a Halloween costume is a great excuse to project a side of yourself you don't usually get a chance to share if you'd like to ""hide"" behind something really fun, wacky or scary. Or, the costume could emphasize a side of you that everyone already knows and loves well, such as being zany, cheeky or bright.
In finding your own style, think about what you wear on a daily basis and what's comfortable for you. This alone may help you to think of a costume right away. For example, do you usually wear cute skirts? A dress? Jeans? Can these be paired with something a little more exciting to form a costume, such as sticking a cloak over the top of jeans or a witch's hat on top of a dress?
2. Think of the colors you normally wear.: If you generally wear dark, edgy colors, you probably wouldn't want to be a fairy, although a dark fairy could be a good option. If you like bright colors, think of pumpkins, elves, fairies, ghosts, rainbows and similar costumes. If you like darker colors like black and red, think goth, vampires, skeletons, dark wizards, evil geniuses, etc. However, don't be afraid to mix and match, as it's Halloween and anything goes.
3. Think back to the styles of costumes you wore in previous years.: Are they still something you'd like to build off, perhaps turning an existing old costume into a different costume? You don't have to be something that is exactly like you, but it would make more sense to dress up as someone or something that reflects your personality.
4. Think of your interests.: What do you like to do? Make a list of the things you enjoy, be it sport, cosplay, cooking, playing games, dressing up, reading, etc. For example, if you like soccer, dress like a famous soccer player; if you're into a certain TV show, dress up as one of the characters you like most; if you like animals or food, dress up as your favorite pet or dessert. Match the list of options to the items you have available and be creative.
5. Decide on a budget.: Halloween costumes can range from cheap to very expensive, so it's important to have an idea on what you'd like to spend. When choosing, always check to see what's included in the costume, as some costumes will be better deals than others when add-ons are accounted for.

A costume containing, for example, a shirt, pants, hat, wig, and belt is a good deal if you get the lot for a single price. On the other hand, a single dress or costume item could cost the same amount as that deal, so you would need to balance up whether or not it's worth it to you and fits within your budget.
Generally, it's recommended that you be willing to spend around $20-$40 on your costume, as most decent costumes are within that price range.
If you need a quick costume on a budget, you can easily turn a white bedsheet into a ghost by cutting some eye holes.
6. Look for sales.: Stores have sales all the time for Halloween costumes, especially if it's very close to Halloween. Be sure to check the TV, internet, and newspaper ads for upcoming sales on Halloween costumes. By checking the sales, you could get a great costume for a small price. If there are no sales, try using coupons and gift cards, if you have any.
7. Keep time in mind.: Are you planning on making your Halloween costume? Make sure that you have enough time. You'll need an idea, first of all, so start thinking about a month before and try to allow yourself at least two weeks ahead to make and adjust the costume if you're making your own. Although it seems early, thinking ahead gives you the space to make something that fits well and gives you the chance to run down and buy more fabric or items if needed.
8. Avoid last-minute decisions.: Try not to buy costumes at the last minute as this will often mean the best costumes are already taken and out of what is left, they may not be in your size or to your liking. However, if you do manage leave the costume until late, read How to make a last-minute Halloween costume to remedy things fast.
9. Check the weather.: It's important to be prepared to go out in any sort of weather, be it rain, hail or shine. Have a raincoat, poncho and rain boots option that can be thrown over your costume if needed.

Check the weather beforehand, both in the days leading up to Halloween, and on the day itself. This will help you make the right choices about what to wear and whether you can get away with not wearing an overcoat and tights or an umbrella.
If it's hot, don't wear thick leggings, a jacket, or a heavy costume. Avoid layers, and wear something fairly thin. Lighter colors are better than darker ones. Try putting your hair in a ponytail so you won't get extra hot. However, if you need to wear layers (if your outfit is inappropriate), just find another costume.
If it's cold, bundle up. Wear a coat, and wear a shirt under your costume so you won't be chilly. Try wearing boots as well.
10. Consider a group costume.: If you're trick-or-treating with some friends, one cool way to wriggle out of being original is to have matching costumes. This can be hilarious for onlookers who see a bunch of the same characters or similar ones coming to their door for trick-or-treating.

Either choose the same costumes or stick to a theme, such as Sesame Street characters. Consult your friends first to agree upon an idea that everyone likes.
Sometimes there are online sales for costumes that include three or four similar costumes.
11. Be inspired in your costume idea from other people's picks.: Still stuck on costume ideas? Here are a few suggestions that you may like.


 – witch, ghost, Frankenstein, mummy, angel, fairy, mermaid, werewolf, Vampire, princess, devil, pirate.

 – Oscar, Big Bird, Elmo, Cookie Monster, etc.

 – Blue, purple, red, green, yellow, orange, or make up a shade of your own.

 Americans have often vowed to leave the country if their chosen candidate doesn’t win the election, but this time around some are actually preparing to do so after Trump stunningly won the Nov. 8 election. 
  
 A spokeswoman for Canada’s immigration department said the website crashed “as a result of a significant increase in the volume of traffic” as election results rolled in Tuesday night. 
  
 Bonnie Quinn, a New Jersey insurance underwriter planning to move to Canada with her husband said she felt “just downright embarrassed” by the election results. 
  
 “I’m not sure in what order we should do things - find jobs first or move,” said Quinn, 35, whose Irish grandparents once immigrated to Canada. 
  
 In New Zealand, immigration officials said the New Zealand Now website, which deals with residency and student visas, had received 1,593 registrations from United States citizens since Nov. 1 – more than 50 percent of a typical month’s registrations in just seven days. 
  
 Rod Drury, the chief executive of NZ-based global accounting software firm Xero, said the statistics matched up with interest his company has been seeing from prospective U.S. national employees concerned about a Trump win. 
  
 Drury said what started as a joke was becoming a reality. 
  
 “I’ve got lots of messages coming through at the moment asking for a job in New Zealand, and we’re saying ‘Yes you can’,” Drury told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. 
  
 In the hours after Trump’s victory, Americans were searching for jobs in Canada at 10 times the rate of previous nights, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job website Indeed. 
  
 “It’s far too soon to guess how many of these searchers will make a move after the shock wears off. But the jump in searches shows how many Americans were surprised by Trump’s victory and are thinking about their options elsewhere,” Kolko said in an emailed statement. 
  
 In Atlanta, business coach Nancy Chorpenning, 62, said she and her husband are looking to move to Costa Rica sooner than their planned retirement because of the Trump victory. 
  
 “I am simply terrified the new administration and Congress may destroy the Social Security we count on when my husband retires,” said Chorpenning, who is traveling to Costa Rica next week to scout for condos. 
  
 After some Americans, often jokingly, said they would move to Canada if Trump was elected, the idea was taken up by some Canadian communities. 
  
 In February, the island of Cape Breton on Canada’s Atlantic coast marketed itself as a tranquil refuge for Americans seeking to escape should Trump capture the White House. 
  
 On Maple Match, a recently-launched dating website aimed to match Americans fleeing Trump with Canadians, users have more than doubled to about 14,000 overnight, according to chief executive Joe Goldman. 
  
 While the pledge to “move to Canada” has been made in elections past, it has rarely played out, although thousands of Americans who opposed the Vietnam War moved to Canada. 
  
 Migration data from after Republican George W. Bush’s 2000 election and 2004 re-election - other moments when liberal Americans pledged to move to Canada in protest - suggest few followed through on their promises. 
  
 While immigration to Canada increased during the years of Bush’s elections, the rise was not more than increases in other years, data from the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies show. |||||""

"Write a detailed description of a trip to Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Massive and lush forests extend further than the eye can see. As our plane approaches, Stockholm's buildings blend pleasingly with the green below.
Barkaby area, 20 kilometers from the city center. Hares the size of medium sized dogs hop away from me, a rare and momentary interruption of the stillness existing here. Residing in the Swedish suburbs is life on Valium.
The train to the center takes 25 minutes, the same distance in LA- double. Public transport here makes life very easy, and far cheaper than using heavily taxed automobiles.
Comprised of numerous islands and waterways, Stockholm was founded where battling currents made further progress inland too difficult, forcing ships to stop and unload their goods, a city forming around the port.
The Swedes are ultra-proud of their clean waterways, pristine enough to allow its citizens to fish its canals, in the city center. Singapore might be the world's cleanest city, but Stockholm runs a close second, the difference being $500 fines for littering are unnecessary here. In Scandinavia there is an expectation to follow the rules of society. The Swedes walk in lock step with each other. March to a different beat, and scorn will be heaped.
The city is incredibly quiet by any standard. On this summer evening, few cars pass us as we traverse the streets; still, Swedes don't cross at a red, I find it absolutely mystifying.
Reading aloud the sky-high prices would make even Martin Luther King Jr. stutter . A wage-flation exists, as unions have successfully gained unskilled workers salaries two to three times their US counterparts, the celebration is tempered by the fact that goods in Sweden rise by the same multiple. A simple HDMI cable runs $30 to $100 depending on length. On Amazon, the longest is on sale for $7. Eventually you numb yourself into acceptance so you don't go crazy.
Swedes- blond, tall, and beautiful as a whole. Doctors here commonly treat tourists with cases of whip lash.
Midsummer, darkness battles to overtake light, never completely successfully. As I doze off at 3 AM, it's seems like more of a daydream.
Glad you liked our Stockholm post..and the lynx! We went way up to the Arctic, and could not see a single moose. I was so glad we spent a day in Skansen Open Air Museum - got to see all the animals of the Arctic!

"""Write a review of X-Men Days of Future Past""",,"The Short- It may have taken 6 films but Director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg have finally perfected the X-Men movie. Days of Future Past should be considered a high water mark for the superhero genre as Singer and Kinberg manage to juggle 2 brilliant casts and plenty of storylines and turn it into a violent, funny, and breathtaking ride and never has something so complicated looked that easy. Days of Future Past is the best movie in the X-Men franchise, and one of the best super hero movies to ever hit theaters and never has a more complicated story been done with as much grace.
In 2000, when the original X-Men film was released I doubt anyone foresaw X-Men Days of Future Past. Following 3 X-Men movies, 2 Wolverine Movies and X-Men First Class Director Bryan Singer and Writer Simon Kinberg found a way to meld all of them together for X-Men Days of Future Past. Following the imminent extinction of the mutant race, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) along with Magneto (IanMcKellen), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and a small contingent of the mutants that remain alive have one last chance for survival. Kitty Pryde(Ellen Page) is forced to send Wolverine back in time to get the X-Men back together and stop Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) from murdering Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) and end the deadly sentinel program before it’s too late.
Since the original Bryan Singer and a host of other directors have attempted to get the X-Men series perfectly, following the bad X-Men, The Last Stand and X-Men Origins Wolverine we got the joyous return to form in X-Men First Class. The Success of First Class put the wheels in motion for X-Men Days of Future Past, We had initially hoped after the nearly perfect First Class cast was put together that maybe filmmakers could get a movie together that brought both groups into one film. That is the biggest gift Days of Future Past gives us, a show case in casting genius and a filmmaker in Bryan Singer that hits his stride telling a story that others would not have been able to. A complicated web of 2 fairly different worlds forming into one and the fact that he has to juggle a cast of nearly 15 major players, along with finding a good way to tell a complicated story about two worlds colliding. I don't know if these filmmakers imagined a time where Hugh Jackman could share the screen with Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, and other wonderful actors and make it seem so simple. You almost wonder if in 2000 when X-Men hit theaters if anyone understood just how great a cast they had put together. Halle Berry has nearly no lines of dialogue but is one of the many Oscar nominees/winners in the cast and that's what makes Days of Future Past so extraordinary. Singer and Kinberg manage to find a way to allow members of both casts to share screen time together and no one does a better job in this film then the performance of James McAvoy who lets loose as the lost Charles Xavier. McAvoy plays the Professor still dealing with the tragedy of losing his friends and his powers thanks to his debilitating injury suffered at the hands of his friend now enemy Magneto at the end of First Class. McAvoy gives the best performance in the film as the Professor, followed closely by another on point performance from Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Stewart and newcomer Evan Roberts as Quicksilver. Roberts steals each of his scenes as the speedy quicksilver, he is also the films biggest surprise considering most criticized his ridiculous look and the poor marketing of the character in posters and commercials.
Days of Future Past is a perfect representation of what the Super hero genre can be if filmmakers don't spoon feed us crappy dialogue and massive explosions. Days of Future Past is so much more than that, especially thanks to its at times hilarious dialogue intertwined with its most serious plot in the series and near R-rated violence. Some characters are killed off in spectacularly violent fashion and would even be considered violent in the comics. Singer’s greatest success is finding a way to sweep us through a complicated story that could have been told in 3 films, instead telling it concisely over 2 hours a feat that is rarely accomplished in the world of 2 hour and 45 minute blockbusters. For a summer tent pole Days of Future Past belongs on the short list as one of the better big budget blockbuster films in the last few years.
It's safe to say Days of Future Past has raised the bar for the future of the franchise, Singer and Kinberg have already began working on 2016's sequel X-Men Apocalypse. The casting rumors have already begun with Channing Tatum looking to join the franchise as Gambit, Tatum squashed rumors that the ink was dried on a big deal that would have introduced Gambit in Apocalypse and then given the actor a standalone Gambit film in the future. Singer DID introduce his big bad guy the titular Apocalypse in a post credits scene reminiscent of the Avengers post credits reveal of Thanos. It is a very brief and a tad bit confusing introduction but just a preview at what is surely to come in the sequel that is scheduled to hit theaters in the summer of 2016. Until Apocalypse hits theaters fans will be able to revel at the glorious return of the X-Men in Days of Future Past, in a year that has been fairly kind to the super hero film fans with Thor The Dark World, Captain America The Winter Soldier as both wound up being fantastic sequels yet neither reached the depths that X-Men Days of Future Past did as it is so far the best blockbuster to hit theaters this year.

"""Hey Elizabeth, it seems like the Beltline has seen a lot of support over the years, starting with Doug and others. What are some concrete things people can do to help out?""",,"(ideas.) Dear City Hall, Dear MARTA. Dear decision makers, dear agency staffers, dear community organizers, dear ordinary citizens who may not have been around when we got started in 2001. Dear young people who were children at that time. Dear anyone who cares about this city’s future – the Atlanta Beltline needs your help.
The enthusiasm and love for Atlanta that fueled our story was real. Not long after I met Ms. Abernathy, for example, I took Reverend Gerald Durley on a private tour in my small truck. A giant man in both his size and his spirit, at that time he was the pastor of Providence Missionary Baptist Church and we were asking him to join the first Board of the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership. As he pointed to the seemingly ordinary houses that were once homes to other American heroes, he described the circular nature of the Beltline in near-spiritual terms. Both physically and metaphorically, it connects this divided city back together – north and south; east and west; young and old; rich and poor; every race, income, religion, and creed – offering a vision for equity back before that was a buzzword.
I am with you and the complete vision all the way (as you know) Please articulate concrete ways in which we, the citizens of Atlanta may advance this important agenda. Thank you for keeping the dream alive and for inspiring others to fan the flame.
Thanks Doug – I just updated this post > A Beltline Call to Action.
Ryan- in your opinion, what can individual community members do that would be most effective?
Hey Elizabeth – thanks for asking. I just updated this post about what people can do to help out > A Beltline Call to Action.

 The Paris prosecutor's office says two more suicide bombers involved in deadly attacks in the French capital have been identified. 
  
 Prosecutors said Monday that one suicide bomber who blew himself up in the Bataclan music hall Friday night was Samy Amimour, a 28-year-old Frenchman charged in a terrorism investigation in 2012. He had been placed under judicial supervision but dropped off the radar and was the subject of an international arrest warrant. 
  
 Prosecutors say three people in Amimour's family entourage have been in custody since early Monday. 
  
 A suicide bomber who blew himself up outside the national soccer stadium was found with a Syrian passport with the name Ahmad Al Mohammad, a 25-year-old born in Idlib. The prosecutor's office says fingerprints from the attacker match those of someone who passed through Greece in October.

 French foreign minister Laurent Fabius says France had the ""legitimacy"" to take action against Islamic State after Friday's terror attacks in Paris. 
  
 Fabius said Sunday on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Turkey that the decision to conduct airstrikes in Raqqa against Islamic State targets was a ""political"" one and that France had to be ""present and active"" following Friday's attacks that killed 129 people. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption French President Francois Hollande described Friday's attacks in Paris as ""an act of war"" 
  
 A total of 23 people have been arrested and dozens of weapons seized in a series of raids on suspected Islamist militants across France, officials say. 
  
 The crackdown follows multiple attacks on bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a stadium in Paris on Friday, in which 129 people were killed. 
  
 Belgian police say two people arrested on Saturday have been charged with ""participating in a terrorist attack"". 
  
 They were among seven people detained in Belgium at the weekend. 
  
 Five of them were later released, including Mohammed Abdeslam, the brother of two suspects - Brahim Abdeslam, killed during the attacks, and Salah Abdeslam, who is on the run. 
  
 France held a nationwide minute of silence at midday local time (11:00 GMT) for the victims. 
  
 President Francois Hollande led the minute's silence from the Sorbonne University - an acknowledgement of the young age of so many of the 129 who died, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris. 
  
 The country has been slowly, awkwardly getting itself back into some form of routine, but because of the feelings triggered by Friday's horror, life still does not feel normal, our correspondent adds. 
  
 French PM Manuel Valls said the attacks had been organised from Syria. 
  
 He added that the authorities believed new terror attacks were being planned in France and other European countries.

 Two more Paris attackers have been named, along with five already identified. 
  
 One is confirmed to have entered Greece as a migrant earlier this year, leading the head of the far-right Front National Marine Le Pen to demand that France immediately stop accepting new migrants ""as a precaution"". 
  
 She said that the government and opposition were ""irresponsible"" for agreeing to what she called ""the flood of migrants"". 
  
 As well as the attackers themselves, investigators are also reported to be focusing on a Belgian of Moroccan descent who is described as the possible mastermind of the attacks. 
  
 Abdelhamid Abaoud, 27, lived in the Molenbeek neighbourhood of Brussels, as did two of the attackers, and is now believed to be based in Syria, where he has risen through the ranks of IS. 
  
 Police have named Brussels-born Salah Abdeslam, 26, as a key suspect, and a manhunt is under way. He was reportedly stopped by officers in the wake of the attacks while crossing into Belgium but then let go. 
  
 Belgian police carried out a raid in the Molenbeek neighbourhood on Monday morning in an attempt to capture Salah Abdeslam, but no arrests were made. 
  
 Italian police have said they are searching in the Turin province for a 32-year-old French national named Baptiste Burgy, who is ""suspected of being involved"" in the attacks, the Ansa news agency reported. 
  
 Meanwhile, French aircraft have attacked Raqqa, the stronghold in Syria of the Islamic State group, which has said it carried out the attacks. 
  
 IS has issued a statement saying the raid targeted empty locations and that there were no casualties. 
  
 Mr Valls said France was dealing with a ""terrorist army"", rather than a single terrorist group. 
  
 ""We know that operations were being prepared and are still being prepared, not only against France but other European countries too,"" he said.

 Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said 23 people had been arrested and dozens of weapons seized, including a Kalashnikov assault rifle and rocket launchers. More than 100 people have been placed under house arrest. 
  
 Seven attackers died in the assault on the French capital, most of them after detonating suicide belts. 
  
 Five were identified over the weekend. On Monday another two were named by the Paris prosecutor as Ahmad al-Mohammad and Samy Amimour. 
  
 Al-Mohammad is the name on a Syrian passport found with the remains of one of the attackers, though the man's identity has not yet been verified. What has been confirmed is that his fingerprints match those taken by the Greek authorities after he arrived with migrants on the island of Leros in October 2015 
  
 Amimour was said to be facing terrorism charges in France. He was placed under judicial supervision while under investigation for terrorist conspiracy - he planned to go to Yemen. An international arrest warrant was issued against him when he broke bail in autumn 2013. Three of his relatives were among those detained this morning

 Raids across France 
  
 French police carried out raids around the country overnight into Monday, bringing to 150 the number of raids under the country's state of emergency since Friday. 
  
 A rocket launcher and bulletproof vest were among the items authorities seized, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. The interior minister said he had ordered that 104 people be put under house arrest since the attacks. 
  
 In Belgium, authorities arrested seven people in weekend raids. Five of them have been released, according to Jean-Pascal Thoreau of Belgium's federal prosecutor's office. 
  
 As details emerge about the seven terrorists killed in the attacks , an international manhunt is underway for Salah Abdeslam, who has already managed to slip through the fingers of authorities at least once. 
  
 Suspect at large described as dangerous 
  
 Abdeslam is a 26-year-old French citizen who was born in Belgium, French police said in a public request for information , warning that he is dangerous and should not be approached. Belgium has issued an international warrant for his arrest. 
  
 Hours after the attacks, he was driving in the direction of the Belgian border when police stopped and questioned him, a source close to the investigation into the Paris attacks said. 
  
 The French newspaper Le Monde reported that police hadn't yet linked him to the Paris attacks when they stopped him and two other people in a black Volkswagen Golf. When Belgian police stopped the car later Saturday, Abdeslam was no longer in it. Now, his whereabouts are unknown. 
  
 Investigators haven't said much about how they believe Abdeslam is tied to the shootings and bombings that targeted people at restaurants, bars, a concert venue and a sports stadium. 
  
 One of his brothers was a suspect killed in the attacks, Thoreau said. Another brother was arrested by Belgian police but later released. 
  
 The French newspaper Le Monde reported that Abdeslam rented the black Volkswagen Polo that was found outside the Bataclan concert hall where three attackers massacred at least 89 people before blowing themselves up or being shot by police. 
  
 Car found with weapons inside 
  
 Le Monde reported that Salah Abdeslam's older brother, Ibrahim, was the suicide bomber whose explosives detonated at a cafe on boulevard Voltaire in eastern Paris during the wave of attacks on the city. The Paris prosecutor's office has identified that attacker as a 31-year-old French citizen but hasn't disclosed his name. 
  
 According to Le Monde, Ibrahim Abdeslam rented the black Seat car that authorities say was used in the string of deadly attacks on restaurants and bars on Friday. But it's not yet clear whether he was in the vehicle at the time of the attacks, the newspaper said. 
  
 The Seat was found abandoned in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil with three Kalashnikov automatic rifles inside, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Sunday. 
  
 Another brother, Mohammed Abdeslam, spoke to CNN affiliate BFMTV after his release from custody, saying his parents were in shock. 
  
 ""My family and I are affected by what happened. We found out by TV just like many of you,"" he said. ""We did not think for a moment that one of our brothers was related to these attacks."" 
  
 French officials believe that six of the people directly involved in the attacks had spent time in Syria, BFMTV reported Monday. 
  
 Two prominent ISIS members, Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Salim Benghalem, may have been involved in planning or masterminding the Paris attacks, a source close to the ongoing investigation tells CNN. Both have been involved in multiple terrorist plots in recent years and are believed to be in Syria or Iraq. 
  
 Syrian passport holder linked to refugee flow 
  
 Attention is also heavily focused on a Syrian passport found near the body of one of the three Stade de France bombers. The passport and a registration document for refugee status issued by Greek authorities led officials to a troubling conclusion, according to a French senator: The bomber was among a group of Syrian refugees who arrived on the Greek island of Leros on October 3. 
  
 The senator, who was briefed by France's interior minister, told CNN that the man was carrying the passport and also a registration document for refugee status by Greek authorities. The fingerprints of the passport holder taken by Greek authorities match those of the terrorist who blew himself up at the Stade de France, the senator said.

 The Paris prosecutor's office on Monday confirmed the link, saying the passport bearing the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, a 25-year-old from Idlib, still needs to be verified. 
  
 The possible tie between one of the Paris attackers and the refugees from the Syrian war flocking to Europe this year has intensified concerns about how to handle the influx of people. 
  
 European politicians who've been speaking out against the rush of migrants are already pointing to the attacks as another reason to close their countries' borders. And governors in at least 24 U.S. states have said they won't accept Syrian refugees in light of the Paris attacks. 
  
 Attack raises concerns internationally 
  
 In Britain, authorities said they would increase security for Tuesday's soccer match between England and France. And in Washington, transit police stepped up patrols to safeguard the city's mass transit system. 
  
 More patrols, more dogs and random explosives screenings were introduced, along with unseen countermeasures meant to prevent an attack, the Metro Transit Police Department said.

Valls warned that France is dealing with a ""terrorist army"" that has more attacks planned, and he said that more than 150 raids took place across the country Monday morning. He said France is using the ""legal framework of the state of emergency to question people who are part of the radical jihadist movement,"" as well as ""those who advocate hate of the republic,"" the BBC reports. CNN reports that the raids resulted in at least 23 arrests and the seizure of weapons related to the Friday attacks. In other developments: A French official has identified the mastermind of the attacks as Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national and ISIS extremist, the AP reports. Abaaoud is also believed to have masterminded thwarted attacks on a church and a high-speed train earlier this year. One of the bombers is believed to have been a Syrian citizen who posed as a refugee, and the investigation is continuing to find links to ISIS and to Syria, the New York Times reports. At least one of the other attackers is believed to be a French citizen who spent time in Syria, and authorities say they're probing a wide terror network that extends from Syria to Greece, Belgium, and France. Prosecutors have confirmed the identity of another suicide bomber. Samy Amimour, who blew himself up after taking part in the Bataclan concert massacre, is a 28-year-old French citizen who was charged in a 2012 terror investigation, reports the AP. The Independent has more on Abaaoud: The 27-year-old alleged mastermind is from the Molenbeek area of Brussels, where police have carried out several raids since Friday. He is now believed to be in Syria, where he is ""one of the most active ISIS executioners,"" according to RTL. Police are still hunting Salah Abdeslam, a Belgian national believed to have helped coordinate the attacks.

"Story: ‘I wonder who had the nerve to commit such a robbery at high noon,’ mused Professor Fordney as he examined the safe, seventeen minutes after it had been rifled. ‘Same old story: no finger-prints, no evidence.’ ‘Found anything?’ asked Lawson nervously as he entered his drawing-room. ‘Not yet. Are you here alone, Lawson?’ ‘No. John, my nephew, is staying with me. Everyone else is in town.’ ‘Where is he now?’ ‘Oh, he left about an hour ago.’ At 3.20 P.M. Fordney noticed Jones, the gardener, working at the edge of a flower-bed. He kept looking furtively at the house while he frantically covered over the hole he had dug. Finishing, he hurriedly walked toward the boat-landing. Fordney, following, reached the dock just as John guided his motor-boat in. ‘Have a nice day?’ asked Fordney. ‘Yep. Had a grand run up the lakes.’ ‘Where were you when your uncle’s safe was robbed?’ ‘Boy, I was hauling in a big muskie! What a battle he gave me! See him in the end of the boat? Isn’t he a beauty?’ ‘When did you return?’ demanded Fordney of the gardener. ‘I don’t know what time it was,’ he replied nervously, glancing at John. ‘You must have some idea.’ ‘Well, it was about noon,’ he reluctantly answered. ‘By the way, John, do you know the combination of your uncle’s safe?’ inquired Fordney. ‘Is that old weasel accusing me?’ ‘No, he isn’t. But I’ve got my suspicions!’ Whom did Fordney suspect and why?",,"He was suspicious of John, the nephew, of course.

Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life. As a person who loves to eat, I consider environment, quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go.

Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called ""Las Ficheras"". It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them, because the good food and funny environment. I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week. 
In my opinion, the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service. We faced continuous problems with the order such as: dishes from another table served for us by mistake, the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking (just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table).

For my luck (or not), I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at ""Las Ficheras"" before and in her opinion, as a Mexican, that restaurant was terrible. She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service. I got curious about this place and decided to go later.

""Pistola y Corazón Taqueria"" was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food, with lower prices and a great service. They served us ""nachos"" with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes. After choosing, a bottle of fresh water was served, again, for free.

One guy taught his daughter Volapuk.
There is a contemporary case of someone teaching their kids their personal conlang, she used to be active on one of Facebook's conlang groups.
The revived languages, Cornish, Hebrew, Sanskrit, have similar dynamics to conlangs. Having government support in the form of schools and day care works wonders for the project being successful.
Getting a child to speak your languages takes time (20+ hours a week) of exposure, and it really helps to have a community of peers who also speak that language, or a child's decision to keep using their parents language will be personal and idiosyncratic.

"How should one convince the client to switch from hourly pay to fixed cost?

I often see great requests for proposals which are provided with preferred hourly rate range. Sometimes the hourly rate itself isn't comfortable for me (honestly, far too low), despite the project is great and I have similar prior experience (say, I perceive myself as a top 10% match). How should I ask a client to switch the project from one that is paid hourly to one that has fixed both scope and cost? What I want to benefit from that is a) time flexibility, b) having it unnecessary to cheat on time to get the hourly rate I think I should (let's pretend I really love the project but not this much to work for almost free). ",,"There are a few solutions to this dilemma.
1 - If your platform allows it, you can answer to the client without specifying an amount in your answer. This way, you avoid being discarded on price only and it gives you a chance to prove your skills and communication abilities to the client.
2 - I found that if the client is looking for really low hourly rates, it's most of the time not worth looking at the project. You'll be worth nothing to the client and he'll treat you as such. Some people are very condescending and will expect you to be eternally thankful for these 3 to 5$/hour they so generously give you... There's always a next project, so don't feel bad discarding an interesting job on price only.
3 - And lastly, be careful of switching the project to fixed price. If the client has set this really low hourly rate, it means that he doesn't really care how many hours it will take, he just needs someone on hand to do whatever he wants. You may be able to switch to a fixed price, but you won't switch the client's expectations, and you'll end up doing many many hours, until you realize that your hourly rate has fallen dramatically.
So I suggest that you write a really nice answer to the client, showing your worth and explaining why you feel like you're in the top 10% for the job, as well as showing a lot of interest and care. Disclose your hourly rate inside the answer, but do not make it definitive (see point 1). A few clients will realize that your offer is far better that the dozens of cheap replies they have, and you'll get the job. Most of the time, these clients will be the ones who already had bad experiences hiring low-rates devs.

Summarize the article.,,"Fresh from his date with destiny in Singapore, the president returns to a future that is all Russia.
Stripped of one of his tailored suits and dispatched to a jail cell by a federal judge for violating bail by asking witnesses via encrypted messages to lie for him in court, will former Trump campaign director Paul Manafort finally flip and become the cooperating witness special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has groomed him to become? Or will Manafort fight to the last legal motion the swelling charges of money laundering, bank fraud, serving as an unregistered foreign agent and obstruction of justice brought against him? Or will he play the role of political martyr in hopes of a pardon from the suddenly pardon-minded president?
By running his mouth almighty, Giuliani appears to be foretelling Trump’s ultimate plans of pardoning his way out of legal trouble while simultaneously decapitating the special counsel’s investigation with a few well-chosen firings. But if this is the Trump plan, what is he waiting for? Does it make sense to allow his attorney to talk so loudly about it? The problem with gaming out a rational Trump strategy is that Trump remains wedded to acting on impulse. Upon arriving in Singapore earlier this week, our impatient president inserted unneeded drama into the summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un when, as the Washington Post reports, he wanted the session with Kim moved up a day. “We’re here now,” Trump said. “Why can’t we just do it?” Aides talked him out of this one.
Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, had such a bad week he probably wishes he had a jail cell to call his own. According to long take-outs in the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, Cohen, whose loyalty to Trump is the stuff of legend, feels neglected and abandoned by his former client. Now the target of two federal investigations, one headed by federal prosecutors in Manhattan centered on bank fraud, campaign finance violations and illegal lobbying, and another in Mueller’s office related to the Russian probe, Cohen squealed for help this week by dropping his defense team and seeking a new one. This lawyer shopping, and signals that Manhattan prosecutors are readying charges against him, have stimulated chatter that Cohen just might flip on Trump. Watching Manafort trundle off to jail can’t have been good for his morale—or his Trump loyalty.
At the end of a week that started with Trump bro-ing it up with a North Korean dictator, the president began to fantasize about some face time with Vladimir Putin. But the conversation about Russia that everyone wants Trump to have is with Mueller. Anybody have a good idea for a neutral site for the parley?
I’m begging to be charged with a felony so I can flip on my editor. Send indictments to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

I'm trying to accomplish write a letter of application for a job. Could you walk me through the process with 14 detailed instructions?,,"So, you’ve found your dream job and want to make sure you nail the job application process. You double- and triple-check the criteria—they’re asking for a cover letter. What does that mean, and how do you write it? A cover letter or letter of application is a single page that sums up why you want and deserve the job. Think of it as an extension of your resume; a sales pitch for why you’re the perfect candidate. We’ve put together a step-by-step guide full of examples and tips on how to write a letter of application for a job. With our help and a little finesse, you may soon be calling that dream job your own.
1. Use Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri font.: Stick with a standard font that’s easy to read and professional. Opt for a 10- to 12-point font size and avoid colored ink.
2. Single-space your application letter.: The goal is to put all your relevant information on one page, and a single-spaced format will help you achieve that. Plus, it looks professional and is easy for potential employers to read.
3. Include your contact information in the top left-hand corner.: Having the proper letterhead can help your application letter look professional. Align the document to the left and include the information as follows:

First and last name
Address
Phone number
Email address
Personal website and/or portfolio link (if you have one)
4. Provide the company’s information.: Including the contact information of the company or employer you’re applying to will put you above the rest and show that you’ve done your homework. Leave a line of space separating your information and theirs, following the same format and order as before.

If you don’t know the hiring manager's name, search the company’s website or refer to the name of the individual who originally posted the job opening.
If you’re in doubt about who to address your letter to, use “[Department] Hiring Manager.”
5. Open your letter with a formal greeting.: Address your application letter to the person listed in the company’s contact information. Use “Dear,” as a professional and polite greeting. For instance, “Dear Mr. Burgin.”
If you don’t have the employer or hiring manager’s name, use a general but professional opening, “To Whom It May Concern” or “Dear [Department] Hiring Manager.”
6. Explain what drew you to the job.: Your letter of application should capture the interest of a potential employer, so be engaging. Open with a strong, declarative statement about your excitement for the position or interest in the company. Briefly highlight traits that make you a star candidate to pique their interest.

Be short and specific in this opening paragraph—save those details for later.
Think of your first paragraph as a sales pitch. What can you say that’ll grab their attention immediately? Is there something you have that other candidates don’t that make you more qualified for the position?
Show the employer that you’re familiar with the company and job application by noting keywords and characteristics valued by the company.
For example: “I write to apply for the Office Manager position at Acme Investments, Inc. I am an excellent fit for this position, as demonstrated by my extensive background in management and proven success as a corporate administrator.”
7. State where you found the position.: Continue your first paragraph with how you found the job. If someone you know already works for the company, great! Don’t be afraid to drop their name, as they could be a valuable reference. If you found the application through LinkedIn, Indeed, or another job website, list that instead.

Companies appreciate when job candidates include this information because it lets them know where people are searching for jobs.
Only include a company contact or friend’s name if you have their permission. This way, they’ll be ready to answer any questions about you and your character later.
You may write something like: “John Smith recommended that I get in touch with you about the general manager position at EnviroRent,” or “I came across the available position on LinkedIn and believe I am a strong candidate.”
8. Explain why hiring you would benefit the company.: Sure, hiring you would ultimately benefit you and your life, but it would also help the employer. Highlight what you would bring to the table. List 1 or 2 accomplishments or experiences that make you the best fit for the job.

For instance, if the company needs someone who can lead a team and handle multiple projects at once, note what team projects you’ve led in previous positions and how you improved overall productivity.
If you have numerical data or stats to back up your accomplishments, include them! This is your time to brag about your achievements and show how you’ve excelled in the workplace.
9. Summarize your strengths, qualifications, and experiences.: In your second and third paragraphs, mirror the job qualifications with 2 to 3 of your abilities and experiences. Focus on attributes that make you the perfect fit for the role.

Scan the job application for keywords like leadership, communication, management, and detail-oriented. Then, highlight in your letter how you have these characteristics or skills.
Avoid embellishing any of your qualifications. Remember, an employer can always double-check the facts.
If you’re not sure what to write, refer to your resume or CV. What have you done that matches the job description best, and how can you elaborate on it?
For example: “In my previous role, I successfully supported an office of 100 personnel and honed my management and interpersonal skills through customer service and clerical responsibilities.”
10. Include details that aren’t on your resume.: Don’t be afraid to paint a picture of yourself in your application letter. A hiring manager can read your resume or CV for the cliff notes of your experience; what they want now are the details. Show them the person behind the accomplishments by highlighting your passions and drive.

For instance, you could express how the company has impacted you personally and why that’s driven you to apply for the position.
Although you want to provide details, keep it short. Stick to a 1 to 2-sentence description rather than a full-length story. Your letter should stay under 3 paragraphs.
Here’s an example: “My passion for teaching began the summer of my sophomore year of high school when I was a camp counselor. I was given the opportunity to teach a class focusing on local plant life, and the campers’ enthusiasm cultivated my love for teaching and conservation.
11. Finish with a call to action.: In your final body paragraph, emphasize your desire to work for the employer and restate your interest in the job or company. Then, let them know you’d be available for a personal interview at their earliest convenience. This is your call to action.

For instance, you could write, “I am excited about the possibility of working for you and your company. I would be more than happy to discuss my qualifications and Acme’s future direction in person or via video conference.”
Keep your call to action brief and open, or provide specific dates you’d be available to meet with the employer.
12. Thank the employer for their time and consideration.: The best way to close a job application letter is to sign off politely and professionally. Acknowledge their time and thank them for considering you for the job. You can also further emphasize a will to speak with them.
For instance, sign off with, “Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you,” or “Thank you for considering me for this position. If you have any further questions or require additional documentation, please don’t hesitate to contact me.”
13. Sign off with a respectable salutation.: Be polite and professional to keep your sign-off appropriate. Remember, you’re writing to a potential employer, not your best friend. Stick to “Sincerely,” “Best,” or “Thank you.”
14. Sign and type your name.: Place your signature directly under your sign-off. If you’re typing your letter, leave an extra space between the sign-off and your name, so you have space to sign your name. Providing a scripted signature gives your letter a flare of professionalism.
If you’re sending your letter via email, import your signature into the document as an image or .png file.

I'm looking for a comprehensive guide on how to poach fish in milk. Can you provide 11 detailed steps?,,"Do you find yourself always grilling or roasting fish? If you're growing tired of your tried and true method for cooking fish, try poaching it in milk. Poaching is an easy way to quickly cook even the most delicate fish. Poaching the fish in milk adds a rich flavor and creates a creamy poaching liquid that you can spoon over the cooked fish. All you need is fish of your choice, whole milk, and a little salt. Then you can choose to poach the fish on the stove, in the oven, or even in the microwave.
1. Select your fish.: While you can poach any kind of fish, you should choose a fish that benefits from the flavor of being poached in milk. Delicate white fish works well and so do fillets of: 

Bass
Cod
Haddock
Halibut
Salmon
Sole,
Tilapia
2. Heat milk and salt in a saucepan.: Select a wide-bottomed saucepan and set it on the stove. Pour in 2 cups (500 ml) of whole milk and add a pinch of salt. Turn the heat on to low and bring the milk to a light simmer.

The milk should just bubble a little when it reaches a light simmer.
You can also replace the milk with coconut milk, fish stock, or broth.
3. Add the fish and poach it.: Place two fillets of skinless fish in the pan with simmering milk. Each piece should be about 1/3 of a pound (150g). The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish. Continue to simmer the milk after you've added the fish and let it cook for 5 to 8 minutes.

Try to select fillets of fish that are similar in size. This will ensure that they cook evenly.
You don't need to turn or flip the fish as it poaches. This could cause it to fall apart or overcook.
4. Check to see if the fish is done.: Take a bamboo or metal skewer and insert it into the thickest part of the poached fish. The skewer should slide right in and be easy to remove. If it's hard to poke the skewer into the fish, it needs to poach a little longer. If you take a fork and gently rub it over the fish, the fish should flake.
Let the fish cook for another minute and check it again. Fish cooks quickly so, check it frequently.
5. Remove and serve the poached fish.: Use a slotted spoon or fish turner to carefully lift the poached fish up and out of the milk. Serve the poached fish with fresh vegetables, roasted potatoes, rice, or a side of your choice.
You can use the poaching liquid as a base for a creamy sauce. Try thickening the milk with a roux, cheese, or pureed vegetables (like cauliflower).
6. Gather your ingredients and preheat the oven.: Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Pour 2 cups (500ml) of whole milk and 1 pinch of salt in a shallow dish. Stir the salt into the milk. Set two skinless fillets of fish, each weighing about 1/3 of a pound (150g) into the baking dish so the milk comes about halfway up the sides of the fish.
Ensure that the dish you use is heatproof before you put it in the oven.
7. Bake the fish until they're flaky.: Place the dish with the fish in the oven and bake it for 10 to 15 minutes. Lay a piece of wax paper or parchment paper over the fish so the moisture from the milk doesn't escape. Check the fish with a fork to see if it flakes. If the fish doesn't, add a few minutes to the cooking time and check again.

You can bake the fish while they're frozen. Just add about 10 minutes to the cooking time.
Avoid flipping or turning the fish over. It should cook evenly in the oven.
8. Broil the fish and serve it.: You can serve the poached fish directly from the oven along with sides of your choice. You can also broil it for a few minutes under high heat before serving. This will give the fish a golden brown color.
Simple garnishes for milk poached fish include paprika, parsley, lemon wedges, and butter.
9. Assemble your ingredients.: Pour 2 cups (500ml) of whole milk and 1 pinch of salt in a shallow baking dish. Stir the salt into the milk. Set two skinless fillets of fish, each weighing about 1/3 of a pound (150g) into the baking dish. The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish fillets.
Depending on the size of your fish, you could use an 8x8 dish. Just ensure that it is heat proof and will fit inside of your microwave.
10. Cover the pan and microwave the fish.: Cover the baking dish with the fish and milk with plastic wrap. Take a knife and carefully pierce holes in the plastic wrap. Microwave the fish for 3 minutes on high heat.
You could also use a silicone cover or microwaveable lid instead of the plastic wrap.
11. Finish microwaving the fish and check to see if it's done.: Let the fish rest for 1 minute and microwave it for one more minute on high. Carefully pull back the plastic wrap so the steam doesn't burn you. Take a fork and rub it over the surface of the fish. If it's finished, it will flake easily. If not, microwave it for another 30 seconds and check again.
You may want to use oven mitts when handling the baking dish. The dish can get very hot, even in the microwave.

"As a beginner in dip oreos in chocolate, what are the 12 basic steps I should take?",,"Chocolate dipped Oreo cookies are very popular at the holidays. Fortunately, making your own is easy and allows you to customize the cookies. Whether you want to make plain dipped Oreos or add sprinkles, chopped nuts, or other decorations, you can serve them to guests or package them to give as gifts. All you have to do is decide how perfect and smooth you want your dipped Oreos to be. Using forks to dip the cookies gives you more messy dipped Oreos, while using a candy mold creates smooth, professional-looking dipped Oreos.
1. Chop the chocolate.: Chocolate melts more easily if it’s cut into pieces rather than in a solid block. Use a sharp knife to roughly chop the chocolate of your choice into pieces. Place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl.

You can use good quality milk, dark, semisweet, bittersweet, or even white chocolate to dip your Oreos in.
You may find it easier to use candy melts to coat your Oreos. They are chocolate discs that are made to melt easily, and come in a wide array of flavors and colors so you can create dipped Oreos for holidays and special occasions.
Chocolate chips also work well for dipped Oreos because you don’t have worry about chopping them beforehand.
2. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in intervals.: The easiest way to melt the chocolate is in the microwave. Heat the bowl of chocolate on high in 30 second intervals, making sure to stir the chocolate well after each interval. Continue heating the chocolate until it’s fully melted and smooth.
Stirring the chocolate after each 30-second period in the microwave is important. The chocolate can sometimes still look lumpy until you give it a good stir and it smoothes out. You don’t want to burn the chocolate by heating it too long.
3. Add the melted butter to the chocolate.: Once the chocolate is completely melted, add 2 teaspoons (10 g) of unsalted butter that’s been melted to it. Stir the mixture well until the butter is fully incorporated and the chocolate has a smooth, even consistency.

Adding the butter is optional. It helps thin out the chocolate so it coats the cookies more evenly. If your chocolate mixture appears thin enough to cover the Oreos on its own, you can omit the butter if you like.
You can flavor the melted chocolate. For example, mix in ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of peppermint extract into the chocolate for minty dipped Oreos.
4. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.: When you dip the cookies in the chocolate, you’ll need some place to put them where they won’t make too much of a mess. Take a large cookie or baking sheet, and line it with a piece of parchment paper to keep the Oreos from sticking to it.
You can substitute a silicone baking sheet for the parchment paper if you prefer.
5. Dip the cookies into the chocolate with two forks.: Place the bowl of melted chocolate on your work surface beside approximately 24 Oreos. The easiest way to dip the cookies into the chocolate without getting your hands dirty is to sandwich one between two forks and carefully lower it into the melted chocolate until it is fully coated. Set the dipped cookies on the lined baking sheet.

The melted chocolate shouldn’t be too hot or too cold when you dip the cookies. If it’s too hot, it will slide right off the Oreos. If it’s too cold, it will create a lumpy, uneven coat around the cookies.
If the chocolate starts to thicken up as you’re dipping the cookies, reheat it in the microwave in 10-second intervals until it’s the right consistency once more.
Be sure to tap the forks against the side of the bowl before placing it on the baking sheet. That will knock off any excess chocolate that might create bumps on the Oreos as they cool.
When the chocolate is still soft on the Oreos, you can add toppings if you’d like. For example, you might sprinkle chopped nuts, sprinkles, sea salt, or crushed peppermint candies on the dipped cookies.
6. Refrigerate the cookies.: Once you’ve dipped all of the Oreos, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator. Allow the cookies to chill for approximately an hour so the chocolate can set up. Serve the cookies or package them to hand out as gifts.

The cookies will keep in an airtight container for up to a week.
When the dipped Oreos are chilled, you can drizzle additional melted chocolate over them if you’d like. For example, if you’ve dipped your cookies in dark chocolate, you might want to drizzle melted white chocolate over them.
7. Fill the wells in an Oreo mold with some melted chocolate.: To get more even, smooth dipped Oreos, it helps to use a plastic mold meant for candy-making. Fill the wells in your mold with approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the melted chocolate. Use a spoon to smooth the chocolate into place.
You can find molds that are designed for Oreos and other sandwich cookies at a variety of stores and websites that carry candy-making supplies.
8. Place an Oreo in each well.: With a layer of melted chocolate in the mold, set one cookie in each well. Press down on the cookie gently so the chocolate comes up around its sides.
While the chocolate should come up around the sides of the Oreos, it shouldn’t cover the tops of them completely.
9. Add a little more chocolate on top of the cookies and smoothies.: Once the Oreos are pressed into the melted chocolate, use a spoon to carefully add a little more chocolate to the top of the cookies. Spread the chocolate with the spoon to fill in any gaps.

You just want to add enough chocolate to the cover the tops of the cookies. Don’t pile too much chocolate on the tops of cookies or they can wind up lopsided.
If the melted chocolate starts to thicken up as you’ve covering the Oreo, reheat it in the microwave in 10 second intervals until it’s the right consistency to spread.
10. Refrigerate the Oreos.: After you’ve covered all of the cookies with more melted chocolate, place the mold in the refrigerator to chill them so they set up. It can take as little as 5 minutes for the chocolate to harden, but you may want to leave them in the refrigerator for up to an hour.
11. Pop the cookies out of the mold.: When the chocolate has set up, remove the mold from the refrigerator. Turn the mold over a cooling rack and carefully pop the cookies out of the wells. Set the Oreos on a serving plate or place in bags to give as gifts.

If you want to give your molded, dipped Oreos an even fancier look, use chocolate transfer sheets to add patterns to the smooth top of the dipped cookies. The transfer sheets, available where candy-making supplies are sold, come in a variety of patterns and colors that suit virtually any holiday or special occasion.
To use the transfer sheets, add a dollop of melted chocolate to the top of the set cookies. Press a piece of the transfer sheet to the Oreo over the melted chocolate, and pull away the sheet. The pattern will be imprinted on the top of the cookie.
12. Finished.: Finished.

A general guide for looking around the site exists on the help page, only shows you how to use the search function to find tags.

If ""Advanced Search Tips"" includes each available modifier, it may serve to include it as its own page via the Help center. I'd even volunteer to try and write it if that is a thing that can be done. If there are modifiers not detailed in the tips, perhaps someone else would enjoy some fun.

"Perché non si può usare la forma dell'imperativo della seconda persona singolare con una negazione?

La negazione di un imperativo nella seconda persona plurale si fa semplicemente aggiungendo ""non"" prima del verbo coniugato all'imperativo. Ecco un esempio che ho tratto del libro  Grammatica e pratica della lingua italiana per studenti stranieri di Federica Colombo:

Non prendete appuntamenti per lunedì!

Anche per le forme mancanti dell'imperativo in cui si ricorre al cosiddetto ""congiuntivo esortativo"", la negazione si fa semplicemente aggiungendo ""non"" prima del verbo in congiuntivo. A continuazione elenco alcuni esempi dallo stesso libro:

Signora, non parli con il direttore. La aiuto io!
Non dormiamo! Ci sono molte cose da fare!
Signori, non prendano questa strada!

Tuttavia, la negazione di un imperativo alla seconda persona singolare si fa in un modo diverso: si costruisce con il verbo all'infinito preceduto da ""non"", come in questi esempi dal libro sopra citato:

Non parlare ad alta voce! Il bambino sta dormendo!  (non si dice ""non parla"")
Non prendere la macchina, vieni a piedi! (non si dice ""non prendi"")
Paolo, non dormire! (non si dice ""non dormi"")

C'è qualche ragione di tipo etimologico o di storia della lingua che ci possa far capire perché questo è così?
L'articolo Imperativo della Grammatica italiana Treccani non spiega nulla al riguardo.",,"Premetto di non essere un linguista, ma potrebbe derivare dal latino noli, imperativo seconda persona singolare del verbo nolo (""non volere""). In latino, noli richiede l'infinito alla seconda persona singolare, e viene usato per intimare di non fare qualcosa.
Un esempio piuttosto famoso è ""noli me tangere"", che letteralmente significa ""non mi toccare"". Anche qui abbiamo la forma verbo + infinito quindi.
Questa pagina del sito Treccani sembrerebbe confermare questa idea, nella sezione 3. Imperativo negativo:

Il latino classico aveva quattro possibilità per esprimere l’imperativo negativo:
[...]
(c) l’imperativo noli o nolite (imperativi di nolo «non volere») + infinito (noli amare, nolite amare);
(d) la negazione ne + congiuntivo perfetto (o futuro anteriore), per esprimere una proibizione categorica (ne amaveris).

Sempre questo articolo suggerisce che l'evoluzione di noli sia una combinazione delle opzioni c) e d):

l’italiano – come anche il romeno e il francese antico – nell’adoperare la costruzione non + infinito per la II persona sing., opera una sorta di fusione tra la terza e la quarta possibilità del latino.

Grazie all’evoluzione fonetica (perdita della sillaba /ve/, convergenza di -im, -is, -it in /e/), il congiuntivo perfetto dei verbi in -are e in -ire (coniugazioni più ricche e produttive nel latino volgare) viene a corrispondere, nel singolare, all’infinito: amaverim > amarim > amare, amaveris > amaris > amare(s), amaverit > amarit > amare; audiverim > audirim > udire, audiveris > audiris > udire, audiverit > audirit > udire. Questo processo fa sì che nella coscienza dei parlanti sia avvertita un’identità dell’imperativo negativo singolare all’infinito, identità che dal gruppo dei verbi regolari viene estesa anche agli altri verbi: ne scripseris > *non scrissere > non scrivere; ne feceris > *non fecere > non facere > non fare. Tale fenomeno risulta già in uno dei primi documenti volgari, l’iscrizione della catacomba di Commodilla: non dicere ille secreta a bboce ([...]). Per quanto riguarda il passaggio dalla negazione ne alla negazione non, può aver influito la terza possibilità del latino: noli passa a non, perdendo l’espressione del desiderio o del comando: noli = non (voler).",,akoksal/LongForm

Swimming is my favourite sport. Why do I like swimming? Well, swimming has always been an Olympic sport, it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer's efforts, but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions. It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness, it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age. Swimming has different types; dolphin , crawl, backstroke and breast stroke.
Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght, it is also the best sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections.
If you will start to learn swimming, choose a place that has an experienced coach, and try to be part of a group of your age.

"""Do you think fossils are real?""",,"Big things sometimes come in small packages, and that was certainly the case for a recent fossil finding in the United States.
Paleontologists working in southern Montana unearthed a 3-inch beaked skull with pointed cheeks, which they believe is the oldest definitive evidence of a horned dinosaur in North America. Though small, the skull helps fill gaps in the evolutionary history of horned creatures on this continent.
Fossil remains of horned dinosaurs, called neoceratopsian, have been found throughout North America, but the fossil record of these creatures is incredibly limited further back in time. That’s been a hang-up for paleontologists because the late Early Cretaceous period (roughly 113 to 105 million years ago) was a time of important diversification for horned dinosaurs.
In Asia, a collection of well-preserved fossils spells out this evolutionary history vividly, but fossil evidence in North America was limited to isolated teeth and bits of skulls.
The tiny skull paleontologists found in Montana’s Cloverly Formation is the first horned dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous that could be identified to the species level. The dinosaur, named Aquilops americanus, had a beak-like nose and sharply pointed cavities over its cheeks. The prehistoric horny creature probably grew to be the size of a crow.
Aquilops bears a striking resemblance to the horned dinosaurs that were living in Asia during the same period of time. Therefore, paleontologists believe a series of migratory events between Asia and North America ensued during the Early Cretaceous, which enriched the diversity of neoceratopsian species.
The exact route these wandering dinosaurs traveled to and from Asia in unclear, though researchers say Aquilops probably made it to North America across the Beringian land bridge. They published their findings Tuesday in the online journal PLOS One.
The study’s authors say species in Asia and North America were isolated and connected multiple times in the past, based on the dispersal and kinds of fossils found on each continent. However, determining what these events were and how they occurred will require more fieldwork.
But one thing we do know now, horned beasts were living in North America for a lot longer than we thought.
They should have named it after Hugh Hefner.
gee, what about plate techtonics-might they possibly have been together about that time?
Everything from asia is small. Why should this creature be any different?

You appear to be in the wrong section of the Discover website. Try looking under “Health & Medicine” and then do a search for Paranoia & Conspiracy Theories. You’ll find an excellent review of a book, “Conspiracy Nation: The Politics of Paranoia in Postwar America.” John, your belief that fossils are “fake” is the biggest leap of all. Do you really think that many thousands of paleontologists (not to mention astronomers, etc.) in museums, classrooms, and field expeditions from the U.S., Canada, China, Europe, South America, Africa, etc., are all secretly deceiving the public, then carefully hiding this grand scheme from their new students until they can “let them in” on the hoax? Incidentally, my son is a successful geologist. I imagine you are probably unaware that geologists use paleontology and fossils every day as one of their various techniques in discovering oil & gas, that in some cases, rests more than a mile underground. You can be sure that profit-driven oil companies would never hire these trained geologists if they were following fake theories. You may also want to consider adjusting your medication… or if you have never sought psychiatric help in the past, consider doing so at once, as you may at some point become a danger to yourself or others, particularly if you continue to pursue such obvious delusions.",,akoksal/LongForm

I'm trying to accomplish become a real estate investor. Could you walk me through the process with 12 detailed instructions?,,"Real estate investment is a complicated field, with a lot of money changing hands. If you'd like to expand your investment portfolio, real estate is a very popular way to do it. This guide will help get your money invested properly.
1. Learn about real estate investing.: In order to invest in real estate successfully, you should research the subject thoroughly and be well-versed in how the market functions. There are multiple ways to invest in real estate, and you will need to evaluate your goals and finances to decide which option is best for you.

Real estate is ""an interest in land"" (and anything permanently attached to land). This means that the real estate market is essentially about buying and selling land and buildings. There are two types of ""interest"" at work in real estate: ownership and leasehold. ""Ownership interest"" is taking full control of and responsibility for land and buildings, and ""leasehold interest"" is the granting of certain rights to a tenant in exchange for rent payment.

The most common form of real estate investing is purchasing ownership interest in a property and then earning money from rent paid by tenants.
2. Identify your tolerance for risk.: There are two main markets when dealing in real estate. These are the  and  markets. Any investing is risky to some extent, but each market has its own level of risk.


 real estate involves the purchase of an ownership interest in ""real"" (as opposed to ""personal"") property. You or a property manager would then operate that property and you would earn money on rent paid by tenants. This is a very direct way of investing in real estate because you, as the owner, are responsible for the property.

 real estate involves purchasing shares of a publicly traded real estate company. Often these companies take the form of investment trusts. You buy shares on the market and are paid dividends as the trust collects rent and value from the multiple properties it owns. Because you only own shares in the company, you are not responsible for the real estate. This is a less direct approach to investing.
3. Decide between equity and debt.: Both the public and private markets operate on equity and debt. As an investor you pick which of those you would like to invest in.

If you are investing in debt, you lend money to someone so that they can buy interest in a property. You earn money in the form of interest payments on a mortgage.

If you are investing in equity, then you are investing in ownership of the property. This means you are assuming all responsibilities for the operation of the land and buildings.
4. Choose the real estate sector you want to invest in.: The four sectors are public equity, public debt, private equity, and private debt.

If you choose public equity, you will want to look at investment trusts. If you choose public debt, you should investigate mortgage securities, which are the debt equivalent of investment trusts, where various mortgages are bundled together to form a single investment.
If you select private equity, then you will most likely be purchasing residential or commercial property and acting as a landlord. If you choose private debt, you will invest in private mortgages.
5. Learn about real estate trading.: This is a variation of private equity investing, also known as  The goal is to purchase a property and then turn around and resell it at a higher price.

These investors try to resell their properties as quickly as possible to minimize their costs of ownership.
Most flippers will make no improvements to their properties, as they can be expensive and time-consuming. Instead, they bank on the market being favorable to them so that they can resell their unaltered property at a profit.
A longer-term flip will see the investor improving the property in an effort to increase its value on the market. This form of investment can be labor-intensive and involve significant expenditures. Many such investors will own only one property at a time.
6. Examine your portfolio.: Investing in real estate is typically viewed as a portfolio enhancer, an investment that complements stocks and bonds. Used as part of a larger investment plan, it can add stability to your income.
7. Evaluate your assets.: Real estate investment can require a significant amount of capital, even beyond the price of the purchase. Ask yourself if you can afford to keep your investment if the market turns bad.
Since real estate is a tangible property, it will require maintenance and upkeep. While this is normally covered by rent paid by tenants, there may be times when there are no tenants to occupy the property, meaning that the costs will fall to the owner.
8. Know that flipping a house can get expensive.: If you decide to go into real estate trading, you have to be prepared for the worst. In the year that it might take you to renovate and sell, the market could take a dive and you'd be stuck with mortgage payments while you wait for it to sell.

Make sure that you have the capital to commit to a potentially long-term project.
Research the ins and outs of house flipping before getting involved so that you minimize unforeseen expenses.
9. Make a plan.: Decide where and how you want to invest. Take your plan to an accountant or investment broker. Go over the plan with a financial planner. Make sure that everything is  accounted for.
10. Learn to rely on other people.: A good real estate investor will not hesitate to enlist the aid of other professionals in order to ensure that the entire process goes smoothly. The type of team you will need will vary depending on your investment.
You may need a mortgage broker, an accountant, a property manager, a real estate lawyer, a home inspector, and an insurance broker
11. Work with a good real estate agent.: If you want to invest in real estate, you'll find it invaluable to use an agent experienced in the field of investment properties.
Find an agent who can help you shop for ideal investment properties. Interview several different agents before choosing one. Discuss your goals and your investment plans. A good agent can show you properties that fit your investment strategy.
12. Talk to mortgage brokers.: Your real estate agent should be able to recommend lenders. Talk to your local banks and credit unions about mortgage financing.
Find out what the brokers, lenders, and banks can offer in terms of interest rates, closing costs and payment terms. Ask about your financing options and choose the mortgage that best fits your budget and investment strategy.

4. The power light should begin blinking; after a couple of moments, the router's light should change from flashing to a steady display.
Some routers power lights will not blink and will instead display a different color when you plug them back in.
5. If the connection is successful, your home network has been reset.
If you still can't connect to Wi-Fi, you'll need to perform a factory reset.
6. To do this, you'll simply remove the Ethernet cable connecting the router and modem from either one of them.
If your router and modem are part of a combination set, skip this step.
7. You'll typically find this button, which is quite small, on the back of the router.
8. To do so, you may need to insert a paperclip or a similarly thin object into the ""Reset"" hold and press it firmly against the button.
9. Your router will begin rebooting.
10. You should see a consistent light (no flashing), which indicates that the router is back on.
11. You'll do so by reconnecting the Ethernet cable between the two.
Again, if your router is part of a combination unit, skip this step.
12. It will be located on the bottom or back of the router, typically next to a ""password"" or ""network/security key"" heading.
13. You'll be prompted to enter the router's network key, after which point you will likely have the option of changing the password. After doing this, you should be able to connect to the router like usual.
If hard-resetting your router doesn't solve your router's problems, you'll need to call the router's customer support hotline for help in diagnosing and fixing the problem.

Describe the Rapide Lite 3D Printer.,,"A team of designers and engineers from Australia and China has launched their affordable desktop 3D printer Rapide Lite on Indiegogo.
""When designing Rapide Lite we looked at current 3D printers and what we found was a big gap in the market between the low-end hobbyist 3D printers and commercial quality 3D printers,"" says Ethan Hunt, Rapide 3D CEO. The company launched Rapide One 3D printer last year on indiegogo and raised more than $98,000USD on the crowdfunding platform.
Rapide Lite has been designed to be scalable and will come in 3 sizes, 200, 350 and 500mm3 with prices starting as low as $399 for our Indiegogo contributors.
""At Rapide 3D we have developed a unique X Wing Axis that significantly increases the precision and resolution of our 3D printers."" Hunt said. The frame of Rapide Lite is built from aircraft grade 5026 aluminum, which are laser cut for accuracy and fitted with other structural CNC milled aluminum components. Rapide Lite's max. build speed is 150mm per second, and a typical printing rate is around 30mm of height per hour.
Team member George Adams said, ""What makes Rapide 3D stand out in the crowd is we have built our own end to end factory in Shenzhen, China which will allow us to control the quality and cost of production. This significantly improves the production time and eliviates the issues that many producers of 3D Printers face when relying on external suppliers for production.""
Rapide Lite 200 features a build volume of 200 x 200 x 200mm and a single head extruder. It will print layers as thin as 50 microns (0.002 inches).
Rapide Lite 350 has a build volume of 350 x 350 x 350mm. It will print layers as thin as 50 microns (0.002 inches) and its dual head extruder allows dual color printing or printing with support material.
Rapide Lite 500 will print layers as thin as 50 microns (0.002 inches) and a build volume of 500 x 500 x 500mm. It comes with a dual or triple head extruder.
According to the team, Rapide Lite has been fully tested with Cura, Reptier and Replicator G.
The retail price of Rapide Lite 200 with a single extruder will be US$999. However, early supporters of its Indiegogo campaign will have the opportunity to receive significant discounts with the first 100 available for $399.
Rapide Lite's indiegogo campaign started on Sep 29 and as of writing, it has raised $18,957USD, 126% of its %15,000 goal.
The first full-production shipment is set to release in November 2014 to early contributors, making Rapide Lite a good choice for this years Christmas wish list.",,akoksal/LongForm

Describe the function and importance of Svalbard Global Seed Vault.,,"It sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie - a giant vault built into a mountain, deep in the frozen wastelands of the Arctic.
But the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is anything but fiction. And if its Norse god-like name didn't already imbue it with a sense of importance, its purpose will - it's meant to protect the world's biodiversity in the face of global crises.
And, in keeping with exactly that goal, the vault, which was started in 2008 just experienced its first withdrawal - by Syria.
Syria's Aleppo seed bank was recently presented with the Gregor Mendel award for continuing to preserve the region's agricultural heritage despite the ongoing and bloody war. The seed bank, which preserved over 1,50,000 seed samples, was damaged in the fighting recently, but luckily, samples had already been sent to the Svalbard vault.
Now, they want to withdraw 130 out of the 325 boxes of seed samples they had deposited - including strains of barley, wheat and grass seeds - to replenish those damaged at the Aleppo seed bank.
With no end in sight to the war, it may not be long before the vault is called into action again.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, nearly 75% of the planet's genetic diversity has been lost. It's reckoned that India alone had over 1,00,000 varieties of rice in the past. Today it is home to a few thousand.
The Svalbard vault is our best shot at ensuring the trend not only doesn't continue, but is reversible.
Built out of an old, now-defunct coal mine, the Svalbard vault is the world's largest seed bank. All told, it houses 8,40,000 samples of seeds covering 4,000 species.
Situated on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, it's around 810 miles from the North Pole. The site wasn't chosen on a whim. Its remote and inhospitable location means it will almost certainly never encounter an outbreak of war. The region also lacks tectonic activity and the presence of permafrost also aids in the process of seed preservation. Finally, its height (it's 430 feet above sea level) also means that it will not be submerged even if the ice caps melt.
But its creators decided to make it even safer.
The vault employs a variety of methods to keep its bounty of seed samples safe. The first, and most obvious are its giant blast-proof metal doors. What follows is a 120 metre-long tunnel with two airlocks at the end before the actual storage facility begins. Seed samples are stored in special four-ply packets and heat-sealed to remove all traces of moisture. Amazingly, the vault has absolutely no on-site personnel and is monitored by surveillance systems that are controlled in Sweden.
The vault is powered by coal produced in mines in and around the area, allowing it to further cool the seeds to the internationally recommended temperature for storing seeds of -18C. Even in the event of a complete systems failure, the temperature of the vault will take weeks to rise to the level of its surroundings which is still a cool -3C.
At this rate, feasibility studies show that most seed samples stored at the vault could survive for up to 200 years even with a systems failure. Some varieties of grain could survive over a thousand years.
It isn't just war that's destroying global biodiversity.
In an age where genetically-modified crops are increasingly being developed and farmers are ditching ancestral seed strains for newer ones, we're constantly losing out on older strains.
Preserving a rich biodiversity of strains ensures we're able to preserve helpful traits for different seed strains that could defend against future and current pests, diseases and climate change.
Ideally, one would expect the world's large biotech firms - who rely on exactly this sort of information - to focus on crop biodiversity.
The sad truth, though, is that they remain focused on a handful of commercially-viable crops rather than necessarily looking at the big picture.
That being the case, Svalbard's role becomes only more crucial. With natural disasters and wars becoming all-too-common - Philippines' seedbank (now totally destroyed by a fire) was once damaged by flooding, and Iraq and Afghanistan no longer have seedbanks thanks to war - a global safety net to protect the world's biodiversity is imperative.
Fortunately, in a remote corner of the Arctic, there is a vault of hope.",,akoksal/LongForm
"""Like bullies and illnesses, lawsuits can be ignored, but they won’t go away. Denise Norton learned this valuable lesson the hard way this week when she found out that a lawsuit she has tried to ignore could wind up costing Norton her North Seattle home. 
  
  
  
 Her neighbor Woodrow Thompson filed a lawsuit alleging that the sound of barking from Norton’s dog, Cawper, was intentionally causing him “profound emotional distress.” In his detailed, 36-page complaint, Thompson claimed that the canine’s “raucously, wildly bellowing, howling and explosively barking” was capable of reaching 128 decibels. For context, the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration — the Labor Department agency tasked with enforcing safe working conditions — says a person should not be exposed to a noise of 115 decibels for more than 15 minutes a day. That said, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Noise Meter, Thompson’s claim would mean that Cawper’s bark is louder than an ambulance siren and just slightly softer than a jet engine at takeoff. 
  
  
  
 “In my head, everything was so bogus that he’d been doing, I don’t know why, I just didn’t think it was real or something,” Norton told the local ABC News affiliate, KOMO-TV. That’s why, even when she was served with papers, Norton simply didn’t respond. 
  
  
  
 Unfortunately for Norton, however, the suit was very real, and because she didn’t challenge her neighbor’s claims, Thompson — who has not spoken to the press — won $500,000 by default. 
  
  
  
 “The sheriff comes, puts the papers on the garage and the wall and everything and saying they were going to put the house up for sale,” Norton said. Now she and her family are fighting to reverse the decision — spending a good chunk of their savings on lawyers — before they lose their home. 
  
  
  
 Mike Fandel, a civil attorney unrelated to the case, explained to KOMO-TV that winning a frivolous lawsuit is easy when the other side doesn’t respond. Getting the case dismissed now that a judgment has been made, on the other hand, will be a challenge. 
  
  
  
 “If you think it ought to be dismissed, it will only be dismissed if you ask the court to do it,” Fandel said. Norton acknowledges her mistake and is determined to fix it. 
  
  
  
 “How can you give somebody a half-a-million-dollar lien over a dog barking?” Norton asked, defending Cawper. “He’s just a loving, nice dog.”

 SEATTLE -- He isn't a prized breed or a champion at the kennel club. He's just plain old Cawper, and he may cost his family more than $500,000. 
  
  
  
 ""It's his birthday,"" said owner Denise Norton. 
  
  
  
 She came to the Problem Solvers for help and exposure for an issue she and her mother Ruth Clark don't understand. 
  
  
  
 ""We're flabbergasted by it,"" Norton said. 
  
  
  
 Their north Seattle neighbor sued them over Cawper and his barking -- and won in court for nearly half a million dollars in the form of a default judgment. 
  
  
  
 In a sprawling 36-page complaint, Norton's neighbor Woodrow Thompson alleged that Cawper is known for ""raucously, wildly bellowing, howling and explosively barking"" and that he is an outrage, with intentional infliction of emotional distress -- and that his barking caused ""profound emotional distress."" 
  
  
  
 Thompson's complaint suggests Cawper is capable of barking at 128 decibels through double pane windows. According to Purdue University research, that would mean Cawper is louder than a chainsaw, a clap of thunder and just a hair quieter than the takeoff of a military jet. 
  
  
  
 ""This whole thing just gets me wound up,"" Norton said. 
  
  
  
 Thompson won his case and to civil attorney Mike Fandel, it isn't much of a surprise. Fandel doesn't have any direct connection to Cawper's case, but can explain how Thompson won. 
  
  
  
 ""You can bring a frivolous lawsuit and win if the other side doesn't show up,"" he said. 
  
  
  
 Despite being served with papers, Norton didn't respond and thought it was bunk. 
  
  
  
 ""In my head, everything was so bogus that he'd been doing, I don't know why, I just didn't think it was real or something,"" Norton said. 
  
  
  
 Records show Thompson was given a default judgment because his claims went unchallenged. 
  
  
  
 ""If you think it ought to be dismissed, it will only be dismissed if you ask the court to do it,"" Fandel said. 
  
  
  
 Norton says she takes full responsibility for not responding to the suit, but she's now working to reverse the decision. So began months of finally going to court to try to unravel the judgment after the lien became official. 
  
  
  
 ""The Sheriff comes, puts the papers on the garage and the wall and everything and saying they were going to put the house up for sale,"" Norton said. 
  
  
  
 The Problem Solvers tried to contact Thompson multiple times in person, by phone and by email. Norton has been unnerved after finding a camera pointed directly into her backyard from Thompson's awning. 
  
  
  
 ""I don't know if it's fake or real or what, but it makes you want to not even go out in the yard,"" Norton said. 
  
  
  
 That is part of the evidence she wants to take back to court to fight the judgment. It's on hold now because the family has poured much of its savings into hiring lawyers. 
  
  
  
 ""He's just a loving, nice dog,"" Norton said. 
  
  
  
 A previous judge did not dismiss the case in part of the family's admitted financial troubles in the past. Fandel said it's going to be an uphill battle to get the case dismissed. A court date is pending. |||||""

What was the Government's plan for the start of the fall sitting of Parliament?,,"There are times when no amount of planning can prepare you for the completely unexpected.
For the PM, the timing couldn't have been worse. For Scheer, it was merely perfect.
The Liberals returned Monday for the fall sitting of Parliament with a plan to highlight what they see as their success over the past three years in making life better for the middle class, to focus attention on their efforts to diversify Canada's trading partnerships, and to remind voters that they have more money in their pockets today than they did under the Conservatives.
It took a single member of the government's backbench mere minutes to unravel those plans.
Leona Alleslev crossed the floor to join Andrew Scheer's opposition Conservatives, denouncing the prime minister's handling of the economy and his failure, as she put it, to defend Canada's interests at a time of unprecedented instability.
""This is not a strong economy. And our country needs strong leadership.""
A defection from the government benches to the opposition is unusual no matter when it happens.
But the timing of Alleslev's defection, and her explicit criticism of Trudeau's leadership in her message, gave Scheer two things he desperately needed this week: a reprieve from answering even more questions about Maxime Bernier's defection from the Conservatives, and a human Exhibit A in his role as lead prosecutor making the case that the Liberals are killing this country's reputation and economic foundation.
""If, like Leona, you supported and trusted Justin Trudeau and the Liberals in the last election and you are frustrated, or even angry, with the ineffective leadership, know this,"" Scheer said directly into the cameras as Alleslev stood by his side. ""You are both welcome and needed in the Conservative Party of Canada.""
It's not clear how much damage Alleslev's surprise defection will cause the Liberals, but it certainly made for an awkward start to the fall sitting.
The government had selected, as its first item of business, continuing debate on the bill to ratify the Pacific rim trade deal known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The choice was calculated. Conservatives support the deal. It also serves to showcase the government's efforts to diversify this country's trade ties with Asian and European nations as NAFTA negotiations drag on — and while U.S. President Donald Trump tries to ratchet up pressure on Canada to sign a deal on his terms by threatening to add tariffs on Canadian-made autos to the ones he's already imposed on steel and aluminum.
The government also had prepared for questions on the future of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, having planned an announcement for the near future on how it will formally respond to a court ruling that killed the project's permits by ruling that First Nations hadn't been adequately consulted.
These are the major challenges the Liberals face. It's where they wanted the focus to be on day one. It's what they planned for as the Commons resumed.
Instead, the PM found himself responding to Scheer's allegation that he had presided over a ""summer of failure"" and that he ""just isn't up to the job"" of guiding Canada through difficult times.
That last bit was a core theme of the unsuccessful Conservative re-election campaign of three years back. It didn't work then, even though Stephen Harper had a long track record in office. Conservatives seem to think it will work now, under an untested Scheer — a bold move.
What the argument doesn't do, as Liberals pointed out Monday, is tell Canadians what Scheer might do differently.
How, for example, would Scheer have approached dealing with Donald Trump during these tense NAFTA negotiations? How would Conservatives have succeeded in getting the Trans Mountain expansion built after failing to get the project going while in power for nearly a decade? And where, oh where, is the Conservatives' alternative plan to reduce carbon emissions without putting a price on emissions?
Liberals insist they have a good news story to tell on the economy during their three years in office. And Trudeau repeated the lines again on Monday during question period: the lowest unemployment rate in nearly four decades, the creation of 500,000 full-time jobs and the fastest economic growth among G7 nations last year.
But none of this seems very forward-looking for a government that will be asking voters for another mandate a year from now. Some Liberals admit privately that none of it is the sort of stuff to excite the party's base in a critical period when party nominations are underway and when fundraising is becoming more and more important.
Some even worry that the government is inadvertently providing an opening — slim as it might be — for the New Democrats.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters on Monday that his party will continue to confront the government with the stories they heard from ordinary Canadians over the summer about their troubles finding affordable housing, or paying for medication.
""While Liberals keep making empty promises that they won't keep … New Democrats are standing up for what matters most to Canadians.""
The Liberals expected to be attacked from both sides, of course. What they didn't anticipate was an attack from within. And that requires a new plan for the days ahead.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Are questions regarding drafting on topic here?

Just found this Engineering stack-exchange site.  From browsing the help and meta, it seems this is pretty new.  I would imagine some, or most, of the users here are familiar with Eng-Tips as well - and in eng-tips there are many (maybe too many?!) sub-forums for different disciplines, software use, etc.  
I'm wondering, since I can't seem to find another SE site for drafting, if questions related to drafting are on topic for this site?

Specifically:
Are questions regarding general best practices in drafting e.g. leader positions, text size, use of notes, crossing leaders, multi page layouts, orthographic construction, etc, etc. on-topic?
What about questions related to interpreting and adhering to industry standards, e.g. DRF construction in accordance with ASME Y14.5-2009, True-position vs concentricity, etc.
How about as they pertain to specific engineering software, e.g. drafting in Catia, Solidworks, PRO-E, AutoCAD, etc. 

These topics take up more than one whole sub-forum over on eng-tips, but sometimes it's hard to find an answer to a question asked on those forums. 
I think the SE Q&A format is perfect for these kinds of topics, just want to know if they are on topic here. ",,"Focused questions on drafting would be on-topic.
Fishing expeditions about drafting would be off-topic as they're too broad.

Example fishing expedition:

I'm looking for the best practices when it comes to drafting a concrete slab for a patio.

If you said bloodily stupid in England, wickedly cold in Boston, or deadly certain pretty much anywhere, it would sound real funny.

"Obfuscation Challenge

You are to write a program that does one of the following.

Only displays ""Hello World"" does nothing else
Quits and nothing else (no output, no errors.)
Takes one line of input, parses it as an integer, displays the first that many primes (or gives a nice error if it is given input that can't be parsed as an integer, or is less than 0.)
Given one line of input, it parses it has a stock symbol, and checks online for the current stock value and its change.

The catch, it should not be apparent which function it performs. Namely, for someone looking at your code, it should not be apparent which function it will do. Also, it may only perform and be able to perform one function (it can not pick and choose.) How good a program is is determined by how uncertain someone is that looks at it as to what its function is, and also how familiar that person is with that language.
BONUS:
If you in a clever way make it so although for any one compiler/intrpreter and platform, the program will also perform the same function, different compilers/interpreters or platforms, it will perform a different function. This bonus may only be collected if done cleverly.
BONUS:
If your program only contains code that is capable of one function (save nothing, as empty code is capable of that), and it is not possible to make a simple modification unrelated to the function to allow it to perform a different function.
For example: if you did
obfuscatedBool = 1g8uhad'l8fygrcetdu8y4fd/,.oe87fy4d --Magic
if obfuscatedBool: print ""Hello World""

Would not count as obfuscatedBool could be made True or False to make it print ""Hello World"" or do nothing respectively.
INFINITY BONUS: If you realize both bonuses simultaneously, you are magic.
NEGATIVE BONUS: Using libraries with specific abilities to do the functions.
Voters, take the bonuses in to consideration, because the program with the most votes wins!

What can we expect from the governor races across the United States? Respond in 22 sentences.,,"With a few exceptions (such as New York, where the major drama ended with Andrew Cuomo’s big win over Cynthia Nixon in the Democratic primary), national political observers consumed with the fight for Congress aren’t paying a huge amount of attention to the 36 gubernatorial races on tap for November 6. But there are some barn-burners underway, along with some potential routs; the outcomes will help shape the political landscape in terms of redistricting and the 2020 presidential contest.
Accordingly, Morning Consult’s latest quarterly batch of approval/disapproval numbers for the nation’s governors is of considerable interest, particularly since governors tend to have a public identity distinct from their party and can sometimes buck partisan trends. The polling firm notes in its overview that all ten of the “most popular governors” at the moment are Republicans. But then seven of the “most unpopular” belong to the GOP as well. Since there are 33 Republican governors (as opposed to 16 Democrats and one independent), the party is overrepresented at both ends of the popularity scale. But some of the “underwater” incumbents are particularly interesting.
One of the “bottom ten,” Kentucky’s Matt Bevin, won’t be up for reelection until next year. Five others (Oklahoma’s Mary Fallin, Connecticut’s Dan Malloy, New Mexico’s Susana Martinez, Michigan’s Rick Snyder, and Maine’s Paul LePage) are either term-limited or chose not to run for reelection. All of them, to a greater or lesser extent, are a drag on their party’s designated successor, even in deep-red Oklahoma (where Republican Fallin’s approval ratio is a terrible 17/75) and deep-blue Connecticut (where Democrat Dan Malloy’s is nearly as bad at 20/70).
Five other unpopular incumbents are running for reelection, and they are in varying degrees of trouble. Republican Bruce Rauner of Illinois (with an approval ratio of 25/62) has been looking toasty for months. Alaska’s independent Bill Walker (25/54) is being mouse-trapped in a three-way race against Democratic former senator Mark Begich and Republican former state legislator Mike Dunleavy and will probably lose unless he and Begich can work out an arrangement whereby one of them endorses the other. Rhode Island Democrat Gina Raimondo (44/47) survived a primary challenge and is mainly favored to defeat Republican Allan Fung because of her state’s heavily Democratic complexion. Similarly, Oregon’s Kate Brown (39/46) leads her Republican opponent, Knute Buehler, mostly because of Oregon’s partisan nature.
The most famous embattled incumbent of them all, Wisconsin’s Scott Walker (42/50), is in his fourth close election in eight years. After trailing Democrat Tony Evers for months, Walker pulled even in the most recent survey from the highly regarded Marquette Law School outfit.
Governors with positive approval ratings aren’t all safe, either. Iowa Republican Kim Reynolds (43/38) is struggling against deep-pocketed Democrat Fred Hubbell in a state Trump carried by nine points but that seems to be trending the other way now.
The overall gubernatorial results will be influenced by a combination of national trends in partisan preferences and turnout; retirements and term limits; individual candidate characteristics and funding; and the factor this post focuses on: incumbent popularity and unpopularity. Going into this election, Democrats had cumulatively lost 14 net governorships since 2010. They will almost certainly begin clawing their way back this year.",,akoksal/LongForm
"""SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that:
            (1) Protection of the environmental and ecological 
        qualities of Federal lands are important concerns for all 
        people.
            (2) Reviewing the environmental impact of proposed 
        transmission facilities is a vital task which must be conducted 
        in a thorough and comprehensive manner.
            (3) A thorough and comprehensive review of these effects 
        can be conducted in a timely manner without sacrificing the 
        quality of the review.
            (4) There is currently no requirement that Federal agencies 
        complete environmental reviews for proposed transmission 
        facilities in a timely manner.
            (5) The length of time for completion of these reviews 
        varies widely, with agencies taking as long as ten years to 
        complete these reviews.
            (6) There are cases of Federal agencies conducting 
        environmental reviews in a subsequent, rather than concurrent, 
        manner and failing to coordinate their reviews with State 
        authorities and other Federal agencies.
            (7) The electricity transmission grid must be expanded to 
        ensure reliable supplies of electricity.
            (8) The Federal Government currently owns approximately 29 
        percent of the land area of the United States including 90 
        percent of Nevada, 70 percent of Arizona, and similarly large 
        percentages of other Western States.
            (9) Because of the large Federal land holdings in the West, 
        transmission facilities must often be built on Federal lands.
            (10) Appointment of a lead agency to coordinate the 
        environmental reviews of Federal agencies will lead to more 
        thorough, comprehensive and timely reviews.

SEC. 2. CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

    The Constitutional authority on which this act rests are the powers 
of Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the 
territory or other property belonging to the United States as 
enumerated in article IV, section 3 and to make all laws which shall be 
necessary and proper as enumerated in article I, section 8 of the 
United States Constitution.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL AND STATE COORDINATION OF PERMITTING FOR TRANSMISSION 
              FACILITIES.

    (a) Lead Agency.--If an applicant, or prospective applicant, for 
Federal authorization related to an electricity transmission or 
distribution facility so requests, the Department of Energy (DOE) shall 
act as the lead agency for purposes of coordinating all applicable 
Federal authorization and related environmental review of the facility. 
The term ``Federal authorization'' shall mean any authorization 
required under Federal law in order to site a transmission or 
distribution facility, including but not limited to such permits, 
special use authorizations, certifications, opinions, or other 
approvals as may be required, whether issued by a Federal or a State 
agency. To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary of Energy 
shall coordinate this Federal authorization and review process with any 
Indian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies that are 
responsible for conducting any separate permitting and environmental 
reviews of the facility, to ensure timely and efficient review and 
permit decisions.
    (b) Authority to Set Deadlines.--As lead agency, the Department of 
Energy, in consultation with other Federal and, as appropriate, with 
Indian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies that are 
willing to coordinate their own separate permitting and environmental 
reviews with the Federal authorization and environmental reviews, shall 
establish prompt and binding intermediate milestones and ultimate 
deadlines for the review of and Federal authorization decisions 
relating to the proposed facility. Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, the Secretary of Energy shall ensure that once an application 
has been submitted with such data as the Secretary deems necessary, all 
permit decisions and related environmental reviews under all applicable 
Federal laws shall be completed within 1 year. The Secretary of Energy 
also shall provide a speedy pre-application mechanism for prospective 
applicants to confer with the agencies involved to have each such 
agency determine and communicate to the prospective applicant within 60 
days of when the prospective applicant submits a request for such 
information concerning--
            (1) the likelihood of approval for a potential facility; 
        and
            (2) key issues of concern to the agencies and public.
    (c) Consolidated Environmental Review and Record of Decision.--The 
Secretary of Energy shall prepare a single environmental review 
document, which shall be used as the basis for all decisions on the 
proposed project under Federal law. The document may be an 
environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the 
National Environmental Policy Act if warranted, or such other form of 
analysis as may be warranted. DOE and other agencies shall streamline 
the review and permitting of transmission and distribution facilities 
within corridors designated under section 503 of the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. section 1763) by fully taking into 
account prior analyses and decisions as to the corridors.
    (d) Appeals.--In the event that any agency has denied a Federal 
authorization required for a transmission or distribution facility, or 
has failed to act by the deadline established by the Secretary pursuant 
to this section for deciding whether to issue the authorization, the 
applicant or any State in which the facility would be located may file 
an appeal with the Secretary of Energy, which shall review the denial 
or take action on the pending application. Based on the overall record 
and in consultation with the affected agency, the Secretary may then 
either issue the necessary authorization with or without appropriate 
conditions, or may deny the application. The Secretary shall issue its 
decision within 90 days of the filing of the appeal.
    (e) Conforming Regulations and Memoranda of Agreement.--Not later 
than 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, the 
Secretary of Energy shall issue any regulations necessary to implement 
the foregoing provisions. Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this section, the Secretary and the heads of all relevant 
Federal departments and non-departmental agencies shall, and interested 
Indian tribes, multi-State entities, and State agencies may, enter into 
Memoranda of Agreement to ensure the timely and coordinated review and 
permitting of electricity transmission and distribution facilities. The 
head of each Federal department or non-departmental agency with 
approval authority shall designate a senior responsible official and 
dedicate sufficient other staff and resources to ensure that the DOE 
regulations and any Memoranda are fully implemented.
    (f) Miscellaneous.--Each Federal authorization for an electricity 
transmission or distribution facility shall be issued for a duration, 
as determined by the Secretary of Energy, commensurate with the 
anticipated use of the facility and with appropriate authority to 
manage the right-of-way for reliability and environmental protection. 
Further, when such authorizations expire, they shall be reviewed for 
renewal taking fully into account reliance on such electricity 
infrastructure, recognizing its importance for public health, safety 
and economic welfare and as a legitimate use of Federal lands.
    (g) Maintaining and Enhancing the Transmission Infrastructure.--In 
exercising the responsibilities under this section, the Secretary of 
Energy shall consult regularly with the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) and FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organizations 
and Independent System Operators on changes to the national grid that 
will improve reliability, relieve congestion, and enhance the 
capability of the grid to deliver electricity.""

Describe the newly discovered unreleased Michael Jackson Sega Mega CD game 'Star Fighter Training'.,,"Has An Unreleased Michael Jackson Sega Mega CD Game 'Star Fighter Training' Been Discovered?
As we all know by now, both Sega and Michael Jackson found themselves working in countless projects together in the late 80s onwards. Following on from the alleged allegations in the mid-nineties, the two seemed to drift apart and things seem to draw to a close. Having said that, there may be another untold chapter in Jackson's video game tale which has just come to light.
Over on the RetroCollect forums a new user by the name of Yakata recently popped online seeking information on an obscure title in his possession. To everyone's surprise was a picture showcasing a potentially cancelled Mega CD game that was an extension of Sega's arcade release The AS1 Simulator. Still sitting sealed with a spine card, this never seen before title featured Michael Jackson in his very own Star Fighter Training - a kid-friendly space simulator for children, unsurprisingly.
As it stands though, the owner of this said unreleased title is yet to provide more information or photographs of this unreleased title. Given the prominence of Michael Jackson and Sega's 16-bit output, it's incredible knowing that such a release has potentially eluded us for several decades. This very fact is also why several members on the forum have raised their doubts about the game.
While we await further information, photographs and confirmation on the authenticity of this game, join us as we get swept up in what could be one of the biggest until chapters in the retro gaming world.",,akoksal/LongForm

Did John Dowd write the now-infamous Michael Flynn tweet sent from President Trump's official Twitter account and should he be disbarred as a result?,,"President Donald Trump‘s lawyer John Dowd should be disbarred if he actually wrote the now-infamous Michael Flynn tweet sent from Trump’s official Twitter account, according to a former White House ethics attorney.
Richard W. Painter currently serves as vice-chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (“CREW”) and is a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. He previously served as chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005-2007.
Many legal experts (and others) claimed Trump’s above-referenced tweet was a poorly-thought-out admission by the president that he obstructed justice because, critics allege, Trump knew about Flynn’s lies when he asked former FBI Director James Comey to go easy on Flynn.
Flynn admittedly lied to agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) on various occasions during a voluntary interview with the FBI on January 24, 2017. Those lies traversed multiple topics including Israel and the United Nations, Russian sanctions, and working as a foreign agent for the Turkish government.
Dowd copping to authorship of the controversial tweet would seemingly limit the statement’s impact on any potential obstruction charges leveled against President Trump, however, Painter’s argument is essentially that Dowd’s alleged authorship is farcical.
I dare you to tell Mueller you logged into POTUS’s Twitter account and wrote “pled” and the rest of that, John Dowd. I dare you.
Shaub is referencing the fact that Trump’s tweet contained the incorrect term “pled” instead of the legal term “pleaded”–an unlikely mistake for a seasoned attorney to make.",,akoksal/LongForm

"Story: Summertime in the southwest is hot. Often, the days are filled with blazing dry heat in July and August, after the humidity of early summer ends around the Fourth of July holiday. And so it was on a hot August afternoon when a group of friends met with the intention of going swimming. It had been decided that morning that Tim McNair and his girlfriend, Linda Sheldon, would join their friends at David Kelly’s home before heading to one of their community’s neighborhood pools. As there were six of them, it was determined that at least two cars would be needed to travel the three miles to the pool. It would be a birthday celebration, as Tim’s birthday was the next day. First, they would have lunch at the Kelly home. David and his girlfriend, Nancy, Larry Roberts and Donna Allen were at the Kelly home when Tim and Linda arrived just after noon. It was already 93 degrees outside and getting hotter. Tim drove an early 1980s model compact car that was noisy but ran smoothly and offered dependable transportation. When Tim parked in front of the Kelly home, he and Linda could feel the heat of the hot asphalt beneath their feet, even through their thin sandals. As they approached the front door, Mrs. Kelly, David’s mother, greeted them warmly as she invited them into her home. Smiling, she said, “Hi Linda. Hello Tim. Are you ready for sandwiches and iced tea?” “You bet!” Tim replied, with enthusiasm. “Yes ma’am,” offered Linda. “Glad to have you here,” answered Mrs. Kelly. “You will have to excuse the house being a bit uncomfortable. The air conditioner isn’t working properly.” The newcomers joined the others at the kitchen table. As they were the last to arrive, they were also the last to finish eating. While Tim wolfed down his peanut butter sandwich and drank his iced tea, Larry and Donna excused themselves to go change into pool clothes. After visiting with Tim and Linda for a few minutes, David and Nancy excused themselves for the same reason. Linda and Tim spent the next few minutes finishing lunch and visiting with Mrs. Kelly. Mrs. Kelly was a wonderful lady who had a very nice way with young people. As they visited, Tim heard noises coming from outside the kitchen. Though, he didn’t think anything of it, as he knew his friends would be preparing to leave for the pool. A few minutes later, Tim and Linda left the kitchen for the living room. Donna and Nancy were sitting on the sofa. Donna wore a two-piece bathing suit with a towel wrapped around her and a pair of dirty sneakers. Nancy was dressed in a similar swimsuit and sat next to her with an insulated case of soft drinks by her bare feet. Larry and David were nowhere in sight. Tim asked where they were. “Getting ready for the pool, I guess,” said Donna. Tim felt that something was not quite right, but couldn’t put his finger on it. This time, he asked Nancy if she knew where they were. She replied, simply, “I don’t know.” Just then, David and Larry walked in the front door. Tim was startled, as he assumed they were in the back bedrooms changing. Larry had on a t-shirt and swim trunks. David looked a bit silly -- he was already wearing goggles and walking awkwardly in bulky flippers. “Tim asked, ""Where have you guys been?” “Outside,” answered David, “I had to rinse off my flippers.” Tim saw they were still damp. Larry offered, “I went outside with him.” Tim noticed Larry wore a brand new white t-shirt and commented on how fresh it looked. “Yes, it’s new. I just took it out of the package when I changed clothes – look, it still has package wrinkles in it.” Tim still sensed something out of the ordinary. However, he didn’t say anything except, “Well, is everyone ready to go?” His friends looked at each other sheepishly and answered in unison, “Yes.” Walking outside, Tim soon realized why he felt as he did, and why his friends were acting so strange. His car was missing! A light bulb went off in his head when he realized his friends had pulled a birthday trick on him. He was not angry or unduly surprised. After all, he was known for the pranks he pulled on his friends. He expected this playful revenge. Looking at them, he said, calmly, “You stole my car.” “Yes, but only one of us took it. Can you figure out who it was?” asked David. Tim laughed, “Well, I know you have a spare key so it would be easy for any of you to drive it away. But – I didn’t hear it start up when I finished lunch. I’m betting one of you pushed it out of sight. It’s a small, lightweight car and I’m sure one of you simply rolled it downhill and around the block.” “Could be,” said Larry, cryptically. “So, which one of us moved your car?” asked Nancy. Donna chimed in, “Figure it out fast. I’m ready to go swimming!” Tim looked at her and said, “It looks like you are ready for swimming, and I know who moved my car.” Who moved the car?",,"“So what makes you think you have it figured out so fast?” asked Donna.

“I felt something was wrong when Linda and I finished lunch and came into the living room. When we went outside, I knew immediately what had happened. I also knew immediately who the culprit was.”

“OK, so explain,” replied Donna, “its getting hotter.”

“This won’t take long. Linda and I felt the heat from the street when we arrived, so I know Nancy didn’t do it with her bare feet. I know also that David couldn’t have done it. When he came into the house, the heavy flippers were causing him to walk awkwardly. It couldn’t have been Larry. His new t-shirt would not have been fresh and bright white with package wrinkles had he pushed my car around the block on a hot day. Donna, it had to be you. I wondered why you had a towel wrapped around you in the hot living room. You certainly were not chilly. Was it that you didn’t want me to see the perspiration on your skin? Oh, and the dirty sneakers confirm my suspicions, of course.”

Donna laughed, “Your car is easy to push, but it is hot out there. So – happy birthday and let’s go!”",,akoksal/LongForm
What is the best performing currency against the dollar this year?,,"The table below shows the world's top performing currencies against the dollar. Poland, which was somewhat shielded from the Eurozone by its ties with the big neighbor to the east (considerable capital inflows from Russia and elsewhere in Europe) has been the best performer among the mainstream currencies. In fact Poland, together with other EU nations who stayed out of the euro area - such as Sweden, and the UK - have seen their currencies appreciate.
There is one currency however that has outperformed all of these by a long shot, but you won't find it on the list. The currency is called Bitcoin (ticker symbol BTC) and it more than tripled this year.
It's not issued by a country, nor is it a precious metal or a rare-earth. Bitcoin is an electronic currency that can be exchanged for some goods and services, particularly online. The currency is not controlled by a central bank. Instead it is maintained by a global registrar and managed via a private network of participants who get paid to ""rent"" their computing power to the network. The ""rented"" machines are used to maintain the integrity of Bitcoin transactions and act as a virtual decentralized registrar.
The network ""node"" providers (called miners) of course receive their payment in Bitcoin, with the overall currency amount growing gradually over time (current value of Bitcoins in circulation is about USD 140mm). The gradual growth in the ""monetary base"" is designed to prevent inflation. This is done via a complex algorithm that requires rapidly increasing computing power by the network providers to get paid the same amount. The number of Bitcoins paid to participants is halved periodically. At some point in the future the amount of Bitcoin will become fixed, with network providers relying fully on transaction fees rather than newly ""minted"" Bitcoins.
For more background on Bitcoins see this story from Wired Magazine (Wikipedia does a terrible job describing this process). It is a brilliant scheme to create a global currency that is separate from governments and central banks. The network however has had its share of growing pains due to hacker activities (specifically on a major Bitcoin currency exchange - not the network itself) and regulators. But it has survived.
The whole premise of this type of private network is to create anonymity online (see TOR Project). That means it is impossible to trace an online transaction. And therein lies the flaw of the Bitcoin concept: transaction anonymity attracts illicit activity. As an example, a website called Silk Road (you won't find it on the internet, since it lives on this private network) sells all sorts of things (paid only in Bitcoin), including illegal drugs. The site is estimated to have made some $22mm in the first half of 2012 but has received all sorts of scrutiny from law enforcement (for more on the site and the market, see the research paper from Carnegie Mellon).
So why has the currency tripled this year? A number of rumors have been circulating in the online forums trying to explain the rally. Unfortunately one explanation that stands out is the increased demand for illicit drugs online. Quite sad actually. Another explanation is the fact that the number of newly minted Bitcoins has been halved again in November, reducing the available supply.
Nevertheless Bitcoin is the 2012 winner for the best performing currency against the dollar.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Explain the differences in Overview and third-party launchers in Android Pie, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.",,"Would you rather have a good Overview or a good launcher?
Android Pie is here and it's got goodies for everyone — except for third-party launchers, it seems. Android Pie overhauled the recent apps screen when it switched over to the new gesture navigation system and renamed this new recent apps and app shortcuts screen Overview, and Overview also has the app drawer built right into it, meaning that you can pull open your app drawer with two quick swipes up from the new pill-shaped home button.
There's just one problem: it's a launcher feature that almost no launchers can actually use.
The new Overview interface is lovely: the app previews are bigger, the horizontal carousel means that it's harder to accidentally tap the wrong app by mistake, and the quick access to any app through the included app drawer means that I need return to the home screen far less while I'm trying to get things done. Then I switched from the Pixel Launcher back to Nova Launcher for my patriotic summer themes, and suddenly the Overview menu got a whole lot less useful.
Because of the app suggestions and app drawer being built into this new recent apps UI, Overview is a launcher feature that still required system permissions. Google won't give third-party launchers the permissions they need to use it, but manufacturers can build it right into the launcher they ship on their phones, just like the Google feed pane that originated in the Google Now Launcher, may it rest in peace.
""Okay, so third-party launchers will just build a companion to build into Overview the way they did for Google Now, right?"" Well, not so fast.
The key difference here lies in the permission levels needed for each feature. The Google Now pane required either a launcher with system permissions or that the client app using the Google Now feed be debuggable. That loophole allowed third-party launchers to create debuggable add-ons to enable Google Now without system permissions that they can't get, and there's no such loophole for the Overview suggestions and app drawer features in Android Pie. It's not looking good, but it isn't going to stop launcher developers from trying; the Smart Launcher team tells Android Central it is looking for ways to try and bring this feature to its users, and it is not alone in that search.
Since third-party launchers can't offer up suggestions or app drawers in Overview, users are left with a bit of a choice. Would you rather have a launcher with robust features like customizable gestures and smart app drawer sorting, or would you rather have the app drawer in Overview and just try to ignore the shortcomings of Android's lackluster first-party launchers?
For those who only use the home screen for a couple of app shortcuts and a cute wallpaper, the the Overview screen will essentially replace their home screen. After all, why go back to the home screen when you can open your app drawer anywhere? Power users that swear by Smart Launcher 5's app drawer or Nova Launcher's subgrid positioning would rather return to a home screen that's set up just they way they want than deal with the dull and often cringeworthingly mismatched app drawers most manufacturer launchers come with.
As for me, I'm stuck here in the middle. Sure, the app drawer in the Pixel Launcher is a downgrade from my Nova Launcher tabs and my Smart Launcher categories, but being able to open any app on my phone in three seconds via the Overview menu is such a time saver, especially when my most used apps are always sitting in that five-app dock below my most recent app.
In a perfect world, I could have both, but we all know the world we live in today is anything but perfect. I can hope and dream that Overview can work together with the best launchers on Android to give users the experience they deserve no matter where they open their app drawer from. But I remember how long it took for Google Now panes to come from the Google Now Launcher to third-party launchers, and so I'll settle in.
I'm going to be hoping and dreaming for a long, long time before that day comes.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Story: I once found this in a fortune cookie; ""You were born to lead, not to follow."" I've always loved taking a leadership position and Student Council sounded like a good way to take leadership over our school. 
I also managed to drag Marie into it. After ""Conspiracy in the Theatre,"" she owed me one anyway. ""I can't believe I let you talk me into this,"" she grumbled as we hung up our posters after school. ""Hey. If it weren't for me, you'd be falsely behind bars,"" I pointed out. ""I guess you're right,"" she sighed. We soon had all of our posters hung up around the school. I took a step back to admire our hard work. Marie was a skilled artist, which was also why I wanted her to help me. ""Well, it took forever, but it will all be worth it when Election Day comes around,"" I exclaimed. ""Come on. We gotta catch the 5 pm bus,"" Marie exclaimed. On our way out, I saw another candidate, Isis, rushing out to catch the bus. I heard a series of clicks and clacks as she ran, but I ignored it and concentrated on the bus. I walked into school confidently the next day. I couldn't wait to hear the admiration of our posters from the voters. All of a sudden, I heard snickering. I turned around to see people crowded around one of our posters. Concerned I pushed my way through the crowd and gasped. Someone had painted black goatees and mustaches on our picture. My worst fear was realized as I saw that everyone of our posters had been vandalized in some way; some had goofy images on them and some were smeared with paint. ""This can't be happening,"" I told Marie in home room. ""I know. All of our hard work, ruined!"" ""You think yours was ruined?"" A girl named Brittany exclaimed. She was incredibly popular and outspoken. ""Go look at mine! Someone wrote horrific things about me on all of my posters."" ""Mine too!"" Isis gasped She was short and shy. ""Oh, this is gonna wreck my campaign. And my parents will kill me if I don't get onto Student Council."" ""So were mine,"" another girl, Norma, exclaimed. She was incredibly confident and fairly tall. Someone was obviously trying to ruin our chances at winning this election. The only question was who could pull it off and why? With this I told Marie, Brittany, Isis, and Norma to meet me by the library at lunch. ""Okay,"" I exclaimed when we had all gathered. ""Everyone hung up their posters late afternoon yesterday, so it had to happened sometime between then and before school today. After you hung up your posters, where were you?"" ""I had to go retake a math test afterwards,"" Brittany claimed. ""I'm terrible at math and making up the test could raise my grade."" ""Norma and I were both in the art room helping out Ms. Riley sort out the paints, but we did see Brittany walk by,"" Isis squeaked quietly. ""Did you two leave the art room at all?"" I asked. ""Well, we had a small incident with the paint, so we went to go wash our hands. But when we got back, the paint and brushes were gone."" ""Did you ever find the paint?"" ""Isis went to check on the paint this morning and she said that they were back where they were supposed to be,"" Norma pointed out. ""Did you ever go into the art room?"" I asked Brittany. ""I never go in there unless I need paint for a special project."" ""Look, it's no big deal,"" Isis said. ""We can make new posters after school. Ms. Riley gave me a set of keys in case I need to access the art supplies, so we've got that covered."" In defeat I got up and went down to lunch. ""I just don't get it,"" I exclaimed as Marie and I walked to our lockers. ""The only people who could've had the motives to ruin the posters are our opponents and they all have clear alibis."" ""Don't worry, Jacelyn. We'll figure it out. And anyway, it's like Isis said. We can make new posters."" ""I guess you're right,"" I sighed. ""It's just that we worked so hard to make those posters."" All of a sudden, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. ""Marie, look,"" I gasped. She looked up at the walls. ""So, it's just a bunch of ruined posters,"" she shrugged. ""No, no, not all of them,"" I murmured. ""What do you mean?"" She asked. ""Look at those two,"" I pointed. Right in front of us were two posters; one for Norma and the other, about a foot below eye level, was a poster for Isis. Neither of them had been vandalized. ""But that's not possible,"" Marie exclaimed. ""No, it is!"" I exclaimed. ""The culprit must've been in such a rush that they missed these two."" ""They were in a rush? Like to retake a math test?"" Marie exclaimed. After school the five of us gathered in the student council room along with Mrs. Cardenelli, the student council advisor, and the rest of the current student council members. ""Why couldn't you wait for a while?"" Isis asked. ""I could've easily gotten the supplies for our new posters in less than five minutes."" ""I didn't call you here to make posters,"" I announced. ""I called you all here because I know who the paint vandal is."" ""Well then, who is it?"" Mrs. Cardenelli asked. ""Tell us and then I can talk to them tomorrow before school."" ""That won't be necessary, Mrs. Cardenelli,"" I assured her. ""For the paint vandal is right here in this room. And I met with her just today at lunch. Will the real vandal please stand up?"" Who is responsible for the vandalism?",,"""That means you, Brittany,"" Marie exclaimed.

""No, Brittany can stay sitting. I would like Isis to stand up.""

""What? Me? That's crazy,"" Isis exclaimed as she shot up from her chair.

Suddenly we heard a clattering against the tiled floor. I walked over to it to find one of the brushes from the art room as well as a set of spare keys. I picked them up and held them high.

""Isis knew that her parents expected a lot from her and being Student Council president is impressive. She knew, however, that she wasn't good at public speaking because her voice is so soft and quiet, so her posters were her only hope. But no one would be able to see hers because she couldn't hang them at eye level. Her only hope of winning was to ruin the chances of the competition.


""Isis told me that she was given a spare set of keys to the art room, as well as that she'd been in the art room with Norma after school. It's true that the paints and brushes were gone, but it was because Isis had moved them to a place where only she could find them.

""Isis did put the paints back after her work was done, but she was short on time. I saw her running out to catch the bus yesterday and she must've forgotten to put the brushes back because I heard a series of clicks and clacks from her jeans pocket.""

""But what about Norma? There was a poster of hers that didn't get vandalized,"" Marie pointed out.

""Isis couldn't reach that one, I guess.""

""Is this true?"" Mrs. Cardenelli asked.

Isis nodded in shame.

""I just felt like I had a huge disadvantage and I didn't want to disappoint my parents.""

""Maybe not getting on Student Council would disappoint them, but I can guarantee that deliberately defacing your opponents' posters will disappoint them even more. I think that we need to have a talk with your parents about this.""

""I just wanted to please my parents,"" she sniffled.

""Can I still run for Student Council?""

""We'll talk it over with your parents and we'll see if they think that you're ready for such a responsibility.""


UPDATE: From the Desk of President Drew,

Marie and I did win the election for President and Vice President of Student Council. Word somehow got around the school and everyone agreed that, due to how much we care for justice, Johnson Grove High School would be in good hands if we were in charge.

Isis and Mrs. Cardenelli talked to her parents and they all agree that she wasn't ready for the responsibility of presidency. However they decided to start her off small by making her a representative on the condition that she had to hand in her keys until further notice and she has to help out Marie and I by doing chores for us and taking orders from us until the end of the next school year.

As for Brittany and Norma, they took the positions of treasurer and secretary. They seem to be doing a good job of it too. We're trying to start a fundraiser that will give us the money to bring back MORP.

Because of this, Brittany has decided to study extra hard for math so that she can live up to the expectations of treasurer. Speaking of which, she passed her retake with 84%. Not bad for someone who's weak point is math.

As for me, I'm hoping that I can live up to the expectations of former Student Council presidents so that this school can be even greater than it is.",,akoksal/LongForm

The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours. We found a small cafe that had a table available after being told that it would be over an hour wait at the location we originally planned to eat at. We quickly realized why the cafe was so empty. The food was like something they would serve at Fyre Festival. The Caesar salad was just a few pieces of lettuce and dressing.

(He's an obscure enough actor that this post might trip his Google News alert, and if that were to happen, I apologize Mr. Lewis for bringing this up, and I have only the fondest regard for you).

In this case, Mr. Lewis unfortunately was drunk when his car crossed the center line and crashed, head first, into another car, resulting in the death of 21 year-old Isabel Duarte.
Lewis, who was very apologetic, was sentenced to five years in prison, but all but the first year was suspended after he displayed excellent behavior by working with a prison-based theater group aimed at making audiences aware of the tragedy of drug abuse at schools, churches and jails.
Here is something else fascinating: Over the course of four years, Phill Lewis only appeared on ""Scrubs"" five times, and yet he remains one of the shows most beloved -- and memorable -- characters.

"""Background Paragraph: When using measuring devices, we often use a technique called calibration to increase the accuracy of our measurements. Calibration is a method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards. To better understand calibration, we will look at the example of calibrating a thermometer. All thermometers are slightly different in their temperature readings. One way to calibrate a thermometer is by using the freezing point and boiling point of water ( Figure below ). If we know that water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C, we can calibrate our thermometer by measuring the temperature of ice water and of boiling water. We place the thermometer in ice water and wait for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, then place a mark at this height which represents 0°C. Then we place the thermometer in boiling water, and after waiting for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, we place a mark at this height which represents 100°C. We can then place 100 equally spaced divisions between our 0 and 100°C marks to each represent 1°C. Our thermometer has now been calibrated using the known values for the freezing point and boiling point of water, and can be used to measure temperatures of objects between 0 and 100°C.""

What did Michael Bennett say about Jimmy Graham after the Seahawks game?,,"Published: Jan. 11, 2014 at 10:04 p.m.

After the game, the Seahawks' defense wasn't afraid to honk about it.
Defensive end Michael Bennett said Graham was soft and the most overrated player in the NFL, according to Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman.
Bennett and the Seahawks' defense were extra fired up because of a pregame dust-up between Graham and several Seahawks, including Bruce Irvin. It started when Irvin asked Graham to get out of the Seahawks' area, according to USA Today.

How to store a kayak?,,"1. Decide where to store your kayak.: You need an area with enough space for your kayak. Measure your kayak and your storage space ahead of time to make sure your kayak will fit. Kayaks take up a lot of room and should not be in contact with other objects when being stored. It is best to store it indoors so that it is protected. You could store it in a garage, basement, shed, or any other indoor storage area. Only store it outside as a last resort.
If you'll be storing it for long periods of time and have minimal space at your home, you can have the kayak professionally stored. Many kayak schools, kayak rentals, marinas, paddling clubs, or state beaches have available kayak storage.
2. Control the temperature of the storage area.: Make sure your kayak won’t be subjected to extreme heat or cold. Avoid temperatures below freezing or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius). This is important so that your kayak doesn’t become brittle or damaged. 

Storing your kayak in direct sunlight is the worst option. The heat will warp the plastic and fade the surface. If you're storing the kayak in your garage, make sure it's in a dark area.
Make sure you are not storing your kayak near a direct heat source either.
3. Wash out your kayak.: Use a mild all-purpose cleaner (such as diluted Castile soap) and a sponge to wipe down your kayak. Make sure to clean the inside and outside. There should be no remaining dirt or residue. Rinse thoroughly with water after cleaning with soap so that no soap remains on the kayak.
4. Dry your kayak.: Although kayaks are built for use in water, they are not made to be wet continually. Water will begin to break down the kayak’s surface. If it is covered and there is any moisture inside, mold and mildew will grow. To dry your kayak, wipe it with a towel and empty any water from its hatch or drain plug.
5. Remove soft materials if storing outside.: Any fabric or soft materials on your kayak, such as the seat, should be removed for storage. This is especially important when storing outside. Soft materials should be stored somewhere dry and not too cold, like in a closet.
6. Cover your kayak.: Whether storing your kayak outside or inside, it is a good idea to use a cover. This will protect your kayak from the elements outside and from dust and critters in a garage. You can buy a special kayak cover, use a cover for the cockpit, or use a simple tarp and drape it over your kayak for added protection.
It using a tarp, it is best to create space between the tarp and the kayak so that water or snow will not build up on top of the kayak (if it is outside) and so that any remaining moisture isn’t locked inside the kayak. To use the tarp like a tent, tie a rope a few feet off the ground in between two trees or poles. Drape the tarp over the rope and place the kayak in its mini “tent.”
7. Find a level surface.: This will allow the kayak to balance evenly. Make sure there is a wall that it can lean against. It is best to store a kayak somewhere indoors. This will protect it from the elements outside.
A garage, basement, or shed are great places to store a kayak.
8. Store the kayak horizontally on its side.: Tilt the kayak so that it is horizontal and rest it against a wall with its cockpit facing out. It should be resting on its side, not flat. It will rest against the wall at an angle.
The side of a kayak is one of the strongest parts, so it will not dent easily. But over an entire season, depending on what your kayak is made of (for example, plastic dents easily), it could begin to dent. To avoid this, flip it onto its other side once a month.
9. Store the kayak vertically.: Instead of resting it horizontally, turn it vertically and rest it against a wall with its cockpit facing out. To keep it in place while standing up, it should be at a slight angle. You should also store it so that its stern is touching the ground and its bow is up towards the ceiling.

To protect your kayak and help it to stay in place, put some padding underneath it. You could place a few towels or cushions inside a small crate and place the end of the kayak inside.
To keep your kayak in place, you can install a couple of support pegs on the outer edge of each side of the top of the kayak.
10. Avoid storing the kayak flat.: For a short amount of time, it will be ok, but storing it flat, whether face-up or face-down, puts significant stress on the kayak. Because of this, it is best to avoid storing it flat on the ground whenever possible.
This includes hanging the kayak from the ceiling. Hoists can conveniently get kayaks out of the way, but they are not very secure, and since the kayak has to lay flat, significant stress is placed on the kayak. Therefore, it is better to mount it on a wall.
11. Find a sturdy structure.: Never hang a kayak from drywall or plywood. You need a sturdy wood beam or strong metal pipes that will support the kayak. Choosing a good location to hang it from is important to ensure the safety of the kayak and the wall.
Most wall mounting storage systems require you to install them in the studs of the wall.
12. Buy a rope or bracket-style storage system.: A rope system works by attaching the ropes to your wall and wrapping the ropes around your kayak. A bracket system works by supporting the kayak on top of the brackets, which are installed into the wall. They are both good, safe ways to hang a kayak, but a bracket system is more expensive.

You can purchase a tilt storage rack for $100. This is a storage rack that consists of two large brackets that you will mount to a wall. They securely support your kayak and fold out of the way when not in use.

You can purchase a kayak hanger for $25. It works by attaching ropes to the wall with hooks. It is easy to install and the ropes go around your kayak to hold it in place. Or if you already have sturdy ropes, you can build your own for free!
13. Attach the storage unit to the wall.: If you purchased a storage system, refer to the manual and follow its instructions. Different installation is required for different systems.

To attach the tilt storage rack, you must locate the studs of your wall and then drill a hole into the center of the stud. You will attach one post at a time, making sure they are perfectly level. You will attach the top of the post first and then the bottom. Your distance between the posts will depend on the size of your kayak. Their distance should be at least the diameter of the kayak’s cockpit.

To attach the kayak hanger, you must locate wall studs or ceiling rafters. You will then drill a hole for the eye bolts. The distance between them should be about a third of the total length of the kayak. You will screw in the eye bolts by twisting them into the hole you drilled. You will then insert a hook into each eye bolt. The rope will hang down and you can wrap it around the kayak.
14. Hang the kayak on its side.: Tilt the kayak onto its side. The kayak should be hung horizontally with its cockpit facing out. Its backside should lie flat against the wall.
15. Attach the kayak on each side of the cockpit.: The cockpit is the strongest part of the kayak. The ropes or brackets should support the kayak right outside of its cockpit, one on each side.
16. Ensure the kayak is properly balanced.: This is accomplished by making sure the straps or brackets are equidistant from each end of the kayak. By placing them just outside of the cockpit, it should be fairly centered, but feel free to adjust the kayak’s position so that it is completely level and not tilting towards one side or the other.
17. Avoid hanging it by its handles.: It may seem convenient to hang a kayak by its carrying handles on its ends, but these are not meant for storage. The kayak will be put under a lot of stress by supporting it at its weakest points and will likely warp.
18. Buy PVC pipe and PVC joints.: Purchase 10 feet (3 m) of 1-inch (2.54 cm) PVC pipe and 4 PVC joints and 6 1-inch PVC mounting clamps to create a 1 ft (.3 m) by 4 ft (1.2 m) rectangular frame. This will secure your kayak vertically against a wall.
Buy extra PVC in case you need it.
19. Assemble the PVC frame.: You will need to cut the PVC pipe using a saw and connect the frame by the joints. Saw two pieces that are 1 ft (.3 m) long and two pieces that are 4 ft (1.2 m) long. Attach them by gluing the pieces together in the joints using all-purpose PVC glue. It will form a large rectangle. Allow the joints to dry fully before affixing the frame to the wall.
20. Affix the PVC frame to a wall.: Place it 5 feet (1.52 m) from the ground on a wall in your storage area with the mounting clamps. Screw the clamps into the studs of the wall in a straight line. Screw in one clamp on each stud (with a standard distance of 16” between studs, this should require 6 clamps for a 4 ft frame), then clip each clamp on the same side of the rectangular frame. This will hold the frame securely in place, attached to the wall.
Install it higher or lower depending on the size of your kayak.
21. Put your kayak vertically into the frame.: Place the bow through the rectangle from the bottom of the rack. Push up on the stern towards the wall so that the bow goes through the rectangular frame and the stern touches the ground. The cockpit should face out. The rack will hold it in place and allow it to lean against the wall.
22. Check on the kayak periodically.: At least once a week, inspect the kayak to guarantee it hasn't slipped or sagged.

"Is there a comment history?

Visiting an old question which came up as related for a new one (Tschau/Tschüß/Servus/Grüß Gott), I found an answer, which I thought I have commented before. But I'm not sure. 
Since there are occasionally comment-clean-ups, I can imagine it was removed without notice. Now I rewrite the same comment I did before? 
I guess there is no possibility for our moderators to verify, that there was a comment which now is removed? That means I might add the same commment and it might get removed in 6 or 12 months from now again, then being added by me in the same spirit as before, producing work for both of us, again and again reanimating an old discussion without progress. 
It proves my point from the clean up discussion here: ",,"As it was repeatedly pointed out and outlned again in my answer to the following post

Why should I edit or answer rather than comment?

comments are on all StackExchage sites not meant to answer but they are an additional tool given to users having gained the privilege to comment to ask for clarification or add additional information to any post.
These comments are meant to be temporary notes. Ideally they should lead to an edit of a post to include information from comments or improve a post according to suggestions made. Comments may also be used to give users a short feedback why we downvoted to give tham a chance for improvements.
In any case: once an issue was resolved or comments were read they should be deleted for cleaning up the posts. This is one of those cumbersome janitorial tasks for moderators which eats up our time. That is why we asked for help by deleting own comments after an issue was resolved, and by flagging obsolete comments. I am glad that many users follow this. Still, there are many posts in need of clean-up. 
We should not expect moderators to read through all comments in a lengthy comment thread (we are talking about 10+ comments) to find possibly hidden valuable information in a single comment in case the whole thread became obsolete or was off-topic for that given post. These comments will definitely go with the whole comment thread on clean-up.
Whenever we want to add valuable information that should stay we should do so in an answer or an edit, not in a comment.
Moderators only can view all flags, comments, or edits, including deleted comments in a post's history:

This also give moderators a tool to undelete accidentally deleted comments:

We can not however undelete an own-deleted comment from any user.
Before we flag a post for moderator attention to undelete any deleted comment of ours we should think twice if this comment really was within the range defined for comments, or if an additional answer or an edit to a post was a better alternative. Whenever there will be a comment delete/undelete war moderators will not hesitate to lock a post to prevent this, or in extreme cases temporarily suspend a user who abuses the comment system in order to protect the site.
Whenever a user flags a comment for deletion we usually will happily do so in case the flag was correct. This is even more so if it was a rude/offensive flag. In the latter case we will mostly delete this comment but if we disagreed with the comment being rude we may first dismiss the flag to delete this comment later. It would not help the site much if we let a comment stay when somebody else felt offended by it.

For the post in question we can not see any deleted comments in the post's history.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Can I now bring my knitting needles, toenail and fingernail clippers, small sewing scissors?",,"For the first time since the 9/11 terror attacks, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will allow small knives and some previously prohibited sports equipment onto airplanes as carry-on items.
According to the TSA, passengers will be able to carry-on knives that are less than 2.36 inches long and less than one-half inch wide. Larger knives, and those with locking blades and molding handles, will continue to be prohibited, as will razor blades and box cutters.
TSA will also permit sports equipment such as billiard cues, ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and two golf clubs. Souvenir, novelty and toy baseball bats -- such as wiffle-ball bats -- will also be allowed.
The relaxed rules take effect April 25.
TSA said the new regulations will allow its officers to better focus efforts on finding ""higher threat items such as explosives,"" and was made as part of the agency's overall risk-based security approach.
TSA believes the items are “unlikely to result in catastrophic destruction of an aircraft,” and policies already put in place -- hardened cockpit doors, federal air marshals, crewmembers with self-defense training -- reduce the likelihood of passengers breaching the cockpit.
“All TSA is doing is catching up with the rest of the world,” said Douglas R. Laird, president of aviation consulting firm Laird & Associates and former head of security for Northwest Airlines. After 9/11 the TSA “overreacted,” said Laird, and put restrictions in place “in the heat of the moment” that exceeded those in other countries.
While small knives are permitted, pitchforks, grenades, swords, nunchucks, stun guns, ammo and spears remain on the no-fly list.
NEW YORK (AP) -- Some family members of victims killed in the Sept. 11 terror attacks said Wednesday that they are outraged by the Transportation Security Administration's decision to let passengers carry pocketknives on planes.
Orangutan. on Wed, 03/06/2013 - 7:17pm.
TSA - designed to scare the public, NOT enhance safety.
So, what is now different between then and now, as regards the ""danger posed by passengers"" carrying small knives? Nothing. Zilch. Squat. A big, fat, round zero. If anyone had the opportunity to pose that exact same question to Homeland ""Security"" (?/!!) and TSA officials, on camera, i would guarantee that their answer would be laughably pathetic. The entire program of restrictions to passengers is none other than fear-mongering, a subtle form of terrorism utilized to keep the public psychologically malleable by capitalizing on the shock-and-awe event of 9/11/2001.
If there was another false flag event in the US involving airplanes, the TSA would be of zero use in preventing it - in fact they would probably be a part of it.

can i now bring my knitting needles, toenail and fingernail clippers, small sewing scissors? YES, LAUGHABLE.
thymesup on Thu, 03/07/2013 - 1:23pm.
.... is that all the primary goals of 9/11 have now been reached. That is, the ongoing “preemptive” wars, the limitations of Americans freedoms with the Patriot (and subsequent) Acts, the financial cover ups and the conditioning of the public to random search and seizures with our ever expanding police state.
We understand the event was a fabrication to achieve those goals, and there is no longer any need to continue the charade as to what passengers carry on board at this point. Removing all those pocket knives is sort of a bother for the blue shirts. Why not make their job a little less stressful so they can collect their paycheck in peace, with minimal effort and resistance.

"Story: The last thing Rebecca Williams ever expected when she auditioned for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof was to land the part of Maggie “the Cat” Pollitt. But there it was, posted on the corkboard right outside the theater doors: Rebecca’s name, followed by Maggie. “This has got to be some kind of mistake!” Isabelle’s shrieks reverberated through the drafty halls of the theater. “Where is Alfred? I simply won’t stand for this!” She marched into the director’s office and slammed the door behind her. Minutes later Isabelle stormed out of the director’s office, her face streaked with angry tears. “I’ll get you for this,” she hissed at Rebecca. She turned and pushed her way past Madge Anderson, who had just arrived, and exited the theater. “Wow,” Madge said, looking over the cast list. “Congratulations, Rebecca.” Rebecca blushed. “Thanks.” Madge smiled. “Looks like you’ve upset the balance of power around here.” “I didn’t mean to.” Madge laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Rebecca. Isabelle’s had the lead in the last three productions. It’s time for her to come back down to earth and play a supporting role.” Suddenly, the door swung open and James Fennimore stalked in, wearing his work clothes: blue coveralls and a hat that said Al’s Body shop. His eyes were narrowed as he approached the list on the door. “I don’t believe it,” he said, shaking his head. “What don’t you believe?” Madge asked. “This newbie here got the part of Maggie! Isabelle called me at the shop, crying and insisting I come by here and see for myself.” “So? She earned the part, James. It would be boring if the same people always got the big roles over and over. We would lose attendance.” “All you ever think about is making money!” “That’s not true, James, and you know it. We’re non-profit. Without the revenue from ticket-sales, we don’t put on more plays. It’s that simple.” “This is so bogus. Isabelle deserved that part. If anyone around here actually cared about talent and art, then she would have gotten the part.” “Stop it, James. We all know how you feel about Isabelle, but it’s not fair to Rebecca to suggest that she can’t perform Maggie just as well as Isabelle can.” “Well, I guess we won’t know until the time comes, now will we?” James’s jaw tightened as he turned towards Rebecca. “But listen here. I’m playing the part of Brick, so I’ll be performing opposite you. You’d better not screw this up.” “I won’t. I promise,” Rebecca said. “I’ll do my best.” “Of course you will,” Madge said. “You’d better do more than that,” James said. “You’d better be great. Or I’m never setting foot in this theater again. You hear that Madge? Good luck filling my shoes if I leave.” James spun around and walked out. “What a mess,” Madge moaned. “It’s so hard to get decent men in community theater. If James leaves, I don’t know who we’ll find to take his place.” “I’m sorry,” Rebecca said. “Maybe I should go talk to Mr. Cooper and tell him to give Isabelle the part.” “Everything will be just fine, Rebecca. Don’t give up your part. Isabelle will just have to get over herself. Now take your script and go learn your lines.” Rebecca took a script from the pile on a nearby card table and smiled weakly at Madge. “Here goes nothing.” Rehearsals began the next week. As a director, Alfred Cooper was intimidating: “I expect everyone to be at their best at every rehearsal. I also expect you to always on time. Imagine that each rehearsal is an actual performance. Do not disappoint me or your audience by being late or sloppy.” “He’s pretty demanding,” Rebecca whispered to Madge after Mr. Cooper’s speech. “He just expects you to do your best, and not waste anyone’s time. We all have to rely on each other for a successful performance. Are you still up for this?” “Yes, of course,” Rebecca said. She glanced over at James and Isabelle, who were whispering together. Isabelle glowered at her, and Rebecca quickly turned away. “She sure doesn’t like me.” “She doesn’t like anyone who’s competition. Just remember that Mr. Cooper gave you the part, so he obviously thinks you’re the best one for it.” They began reading lines and working on blocking. After rehearsal was over, Rebecca went backstage to get her things. She stopped and stood perfectly still when she heard Isabelle and James talking in the wings. “I told Mr. Cooper that it’s not fair! Her Maggie isn’t nearly as good as mine would be. All he said was that she was doing great and that as long as she doesn’t flake out and miss rehearsal then she gets to keep the part. It’s so unfair!” Isabelle looked over and caught Rebecca staring at her. “I hate you,” she whispered. Rebecca turned around quickly and left. The next day Rebecca took her script with her to work. In the afternoon she was surprised to look up and see Madge walk in. “What a nice surprise! Are you a patient of Dr. Green?” Rebecca asked. “Actually I am, but that’s not why I stopped by. My car got a flat tire and since I’m hopeless with anything mechanical, I don’t know how to change it. Luckily I was nearby and was able to make it to the parking lot. I called my husband to come and change the tire. I was wondering if I could wait inside here since it’s so cold outside.” “Of course you can,” Rebecca said. “Look, Rebecca,” Madge said. “I’ve talked to Mr. Cooper about Isabelle. He agrees that she’s been a real pain. He even admits that he almost wishes he’d given her the part of Maggie so she’d stop causing trouble. Sometimes I almost agree.” “Oh.” “No, wait, I’m not finished. He said that even though it would have been easier to give her the part, never has he for a moment regretted giving it to you. He said if he had to go back and do it over, he wouldn’t change a thing.” Rebecca sighed. “Thanks, Madge. I just wish Isabelle didn’t hate me so much.” “Don’t worry about Isabelle. She’s just moody because she hates her job at the bakery so much, and she takes it out on everyone around her. She’ll probably be in bad a mood tonight since she works all afternoon, but just ignore it.” Madge left as soon as her tire was changed. When the workday was finally over, Rebecca headed out to her car. She had just enough time to make it to rehearsal. She got into her car and turned the key, but nothing happened. She tried a few more times, but the car still wouldn’t start. Panicked, Rebecca called her car service. When he arrived, the service member opened her hood. “Looks like someone disconnected your battery,” he said, hooking the cables back up. “Thank you,” Rebecca said, jumping into the car. She sped over to the theater and ran inside. Alfred Cooper was standing with his hands on his hips. James, Isabelle and Madge were running lines. They all looked up when Rebecca ran in. “Nice of you to join us, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said. “But if you can’t take your commitment seriously, then I’m sure we can find someone else who can.” “No, please Mr. Cooper,” Rebecca said. “Someone disconnected the battery to my car while I was at work. I was set up!” Isabelle scoffed. “Oh sure, Rebecca. Like we’re going to believe that.” “No, it’s true!” Rebecca said. “And no matter what some of you think, I am definitely committed to being in this play. In fact, I’ll prove it by exposing the person who did this to me.” Who disconnected the battery?",,"“We’re listening, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said.

“Well, let’s think about this,” Rebecca said. “I know Madge couldn’t have sabotaged my car, because she doesn’t know anything about cars. She said so herself.”

“That’s definitely true!” Madge said.

Rebecca turned to Isabelle. “And it wasn’t you, Isabelle, because you were working at the bakery all afternoon. Looks like you brought some of it with you, too.” Isabelle gasped and looked down at her shirt. There was a smear of chocolate and powdered sugar on her chest.

“And I know it wasn’t you, Mr. Cooper, because you told Madge that you wouldn’t change your casting decision even if you could. That only leaves James, who just happens to work at a body shop and has an extensive knowledge of cars.”

Mr. Cooper turned to James. “Well, James?”

Everyone’s focus was on James. “Oh, fine!” he said. “I did it. I unhooked the cables to Rebecca’s car battery. But I only did it so Rebecca would be kicked out and Isabelle would get her part. I just wanted to make Isabelle happy.”

Mr. Cooper sighed. “Well, what should we do about this, Rebecca? It’s up to you. Should we recast James’s part?”

“No,” Rebecca said. “Male parts are so hard to cast. But how about free oil changes for the entire cast, James?”

“Deal,” James said.",,akoksal/LongForm
Please provide advice on how to ensure an app can be built in the future.,,"It sometimes happen that after a few years, an app is stable enough that it gets into hibernating mode. Though it’s used and useful, there are no changes to it and it happily runs its life. Then, after a while, someone decides to add some new features again. Apart from simple things such as locating the sources, one of the most important thing is to be able to build the app. Though it may seem trivial, there are some things to think about. Here are some advices on how to make apps that can be built forever.
I’ll use Maven as an example but advices below can apply to any build tool.
For dependencies, Maven requires the version to be set. For plugins, Maven allows not to specify it. In that case, it will fetch the latest.
Though it might be seen as a benefit to always use the latest version, it can break existing behavior.
Always explicitly set plugins version. This includes all plugins that are used during the build, even if they are not configured e.g. maven-surefire-plugin.
The second problem that may arise is the build tool itself. What Maven version that was used to build the app? Building the app with another version might not work. Or worse, build the app in a slightly different way with unexpected side-effects.
Hence, the build tool must be saved along the sources of the app. In the Maven ecosystem, this can be done using the Maven wrapper.
The last step occurs when JVM options are tweaked using the MVN_OPTS environment variable. It can be used to initialize the maximum amount of memory for the build e.g. -XmX or to pass system properties to the build e.g. -Dmy.property=3. Instead of using the MVN_OPTS environment variable, such parameters should be set in a .mvn/jvm.config file, and checked in along the app sources. Note this is available since Maven 3.3.1.
The build file that is relevant to the continuous integration server should be checked in as well. For some - Travis CI, GitLab, etc., it’s a pretty standard practice. For others - Jenkins, it’s a brand new feature.
Check in the CI server specific build files along regular sources.
The above steps try to ensure that as many things as possible are immutable. While the version of the Java code and the version of the generated bytecode can be set (source and target configuration parameters of the maven-compiler-plugin), one thing that cannot be set is the JDK itself.
In order to keep it immutable along the whole application life, it’s advised to specify the exact JDK. In turn, this depends a lot on the exact continuous integration server. For example, Travis CI allows it natively in the build file, while Jenkins might require the usage of a Docker image.
Making sure to be able to build your app in the future is not a glamorous task. However, it can make a huge difference in the future. Following the above rules, chances you’ll be able to build apps, after they have been hibernating for a long time, will dramatically increase.",,akoksal/LongForm

"Story: The beach was crowded, and Glen had to be careful as he maneuvered in and out and around the multitude of bathers and sun-worshippers with his metal detector. It was a hot day even for July 1st, not a cloud in the sky and that had brought out the hordes anxious to escape the nitty-gritty furnace of the city. It was only eleven in the morning, but Glen had already made a pretty good haul – $4.65 in loose change, a pair of slightly bent sunglasses, one fully functioning watch and two rings (one of which appeared to be at least 10K gold). People sometimes made fun of Glen as he scouted around with his long-handled magnetic machine, sweeping it back and forth over the ground, headphones on, listening for the beeping sound that signaled buried metal. But he looked at it this way: not only was he enriching himself to a certain extent (to supplement his meager teacher’s pension) and getting some much-needed exercise, but he was also providing a community service. Because along with the valuables, he also uncovered and removed from the dirt or the sand loose can pull-tabs, bottle caps and openers, misplaced keys and other sharp metal objects which could cut unsuspecting bare feet or other body parts, if stepped on or fallen on the wrong way. Glen pushed back the floppy brim of his Tilley hat and mopped his forehead, promising himself a hot dog and cold soda for lunch with the money he’d found. He was up by the entrance to the beach, and as he bent his head and machine back down, he noticed a plastic bag sticking out of the sand about ten feet to his left. Often his bespectacled eyes were just as adept as his metal-detecting machine at finding treasure, and such was the case here. Because as Glen bent down and pulled the sealed plastic sandwich bag out of the sand, he saw that it contained money – lots of it, in bills and coins. He grinned, eyes lighting up like a slot machine that’s hit Jackpot! Then he frowned slightly, noting that the brightly colored bills and large golden and silver coins weren’t good ol’ American greenbacks and change, but rather Canadian currency. Sadly, they were not legal tender in Nebraska, where Glen lived. But the money could still be exchanged at a bank for American cash (at a slight discount, given the Canadian dollar’s lower value relative to the US dollar). Glen’s grin went back up again, as he prepared to open the baggie and count up his loot. Suddenly, though, he was surrounded by four fellow beachgoers who’d seen him pick up the moneybag. They closed in on him, loudly proclaiming the dough as their own. Glen quickly stashed the found money in his fanny pack for safekeeping and then held up his hand. “Hold on, folks!” he addressed the two men, one woman and one child, all of whom were clad in nothing but swimsuits. “What do you mean ‘hold on’?” the stocky blonde man protested. “That’s my money. It dropped out of my pants pocket on my way onto the beach. Now give it here!” “Not so fast, Blondie,” the redheaded woman cut in. “That’s my cash. I put it in the plastic baggie so I could bury it in the sand beneath my clothing – so it wouldn’t get stolen when I went swimming. But I lost it on my way down to the beach.” “That money’s mine, mister!” the tall bald man exclaimed. “I keep it in a plastic baggie when I go to the beach so it doesn’t get wet. I’m Canadian. I’d show you my passport … but I don’t have it with me.” He gestured at his swim trunks. “I’m Canadian, too,” the little black-haired girl stated, looking forlornly up at Glen. “My parents and I are visiting my sick Grandmother down here. That’s all the money I brought with me to buy presents for her. I put it in a plastic bag to take to the bank to change into American money.” She reached for Glen’s fanny pack. He took a step back, holding his metal detector up as a barrier to the avarice crowd. As a former schoolteacher, he knew a little something about the Great White North, having taught North American studies in high school for years. So, like all teachers, he felt that a pop quiz was in order, to identify the true Canuck owner of the Canadian currency. “How many provinces are there in Canada, young lady?” he asked the little black-haired girl. “Ten,” she promptly replied, smiling sweetly. “And what’s the capital city of Canada?” “Toronto,” she responded, just as confidently. Glen turned to the stocky blonde man. “What are Canada’s two official languages, sir?” The man grunted and grinned. “They are English and French, of course.” “And who was the earliest European explorer to discover Canada?” “You mean besides the Vikings?” He scratched his chin. “Well, it was, of course … Jacques Cartier.” He held out a hand for the cash. Glen moved on to the tall bald man, giving nothing away. “What’s on the Canadian flag, sir?” “It is a maple leaf,” the man instantly answered, “a red maple leaf.” “And what is the largest lake situated entirely in your country?” Glen asked. The man hesitated, turning even redder than his sunburn. “Uh, well, that’s kind of a tough one …” The little black-haired girl giggled. “Let’s see, Lake Winnipeg is quite large. And there’s, uh, Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, up in the Northwest Territories.” He shrugged. “To be honest, I’m not a hundred percent sure which is the largest.” The redheaded woman snorted. “Honest, he says.” “Okay,” Glen said, turning to her. “Does Canada have a President, like we do?” The woman smiled. “What is this, twenty questions? We have a Prime Minister.” “And whose picture is on the Canadian one-dollar bill, madam?” “The one-dollar bill? Why, um, that would be … the Queen!” Glen unzipped his fanny pack and pulled out the plastic baggie full of Canadian currency. “I can now return this to its rightful owner,” he stated. Who does the money belong to?",,"The tall bald man is the rightful Canadian owner of the Canadian money. He’s the only one who didn’t answer any of Glen’s questions incorrectly; questions that most, if not all, Canadian citizens would know the answers to.

Ottawa is, in fact, the capital of Canada, not Toronto (Canada’s largest city), as the little black-haired girl said. And John Cabot was actually the first European explorer to reach Canada, in 1497. Not Jacques Cartier, as the stocky blonde man stated (Cartier didn’t reach the New World until 1534). And the Queen is indeed on the Canadian dollar, as the redheaded woman said, only Canada doesn’t have one-dollar ‘bills’, they have one-dollar ‘coins’ – loonies, as Canadians call them, because of the loon depicted on the opposite side of the coin from the Queen.

The tall bald man was correct about there being a red Maple Leaf on his country’s flag. And while he couldn’t name the exact Canadian lake that is the largest – a tough question even for Canadians – he did mention it: Great Bear Lake.",,akoksal/LongForm
I'm struggling with mental health and need help.,,"Technology can help those with mental illness deal with their symptoms.
Even though some experts believe that our increasing reliance on technology can breed more chances for mental illness to develop, there are ways that technology can help those with mental illness deal with their symptoms, such as mental health apps. Although they aren't a substitute for actual health care, the following apps are helping many users cope with their illnesses and get back to the business of living — for free.
Feeling isolated? Connect instantly with one of 160,000 trained volunteer listeners and licensed therapists with 7 Cups. The app engages users in anonymous, free, confidential conversations so you can vent about your day or simply hear a human voice. It also gives the option to connect with multiple users and to participate in guided discussions in group support chat rooms.
Those battling anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder can work toward establishing a healthy relationship with food via Recovery Record. Using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and self-monitoring research, the app can help users record their meals, thoughts, and feelings as well as customized meal plans, recovery goals, and coping tactics.
Mental illness isn't a game, but the app SuperBetter tastefully takes a gaming approach to managing depression, anxiety, chronic illness, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Players earn rewards for completing real-life exercises that help them build positive skills and behaviors like resilience and optimism.
Although PTSD Coach was created with US military veterans in mind, it may be beneficial for anyone suffering from PTSD. It offers education and insights about the disorder itself as well information about professional care options. Interactive elements include a self-assessment exam and coping tools such as positive self-talk and anger management exercises.
Moodpath, which bills itself as ""your mental health companion,"" screens users for depressive behavior via daily questions designed to increase their awareness of their thoughts and emotions. After 14 days, the app will generate a report about your condition that you can bring to a mental health professional for discussion. More than 150 videos and exercises are available, too.
Created by Pacifica Labs Inc.
When anxiety has you tight in its clutches, it can feel like your world is going to end. But Pacifica helps users find a place of peace via psychologist-designed tools. Based on CBT, mood and health tracking, relaxation, and mindfulness meditation, the app targets the ongoing cycles of negative thoughts that lead to anxiety, stress, and depression.
Last fall, Pear reSET became the first FDA-approved prescription app for substance abuse. The ""mobile digital therapy"" provides a series of interactive lessons to be used over a period of 12 weeks. It features short quizzes, virtual rewards, and weekly check-ins to ensure progress. Note that reSET requires a prescription to access.
If you've never meditated before or find it difficult, Headspace is a great place to start. The popular app takes you by the hand and leads you through guided meditations and mindfulness techniques to help establish calm and wellness in your life. The free basics course teaches you meditation fundamentals; the full library is accessible via a subscription fee.
Anxiety Relief Hypnosis promises to target the subconscious thoughts that lead to anxiety via the power of hypnosis. It features audio read by a certified hypnotherapist, accompanied by peaceful ambient music. After daily use for one to three weeks, users may experience less stress and more relaxation.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Can regular drip coffee grounds be used for pour over coffee and achieve good results?

Can you use regular drip coffee for pour over, and if you do will the coffee taste OK?",,"Yes, it'll be fine.
Drip brewing and pour-over coffee are essentially the same process:  Pour hot water over ground coffee to extract flavor compounds, then let the infused hot water solution drip through a filter into a serving vessel.  As far as the final product is concerned, it doesn't especially matter if this happens in a machine that dispenses the hot water automatically (drip brewing), or if you pour the water yourself by hand.
The only reason coffee grounds might be suitable for one but not the other would be if you use different filters for drip brewing and pourovers.  For instance, if you have a drip coffee machine that takes paper filters, but a standalone metal mesh filter that you use for pourovers, you would want to use slightly coarser coffee grounds for the latter.  Even in this case, though, the worst possible outcome would be that your coffee might be a little cloudy or gritty, just like if your grounds were slightly too fine (because that's exactly what's happened).",,akoksal/LongForm
Describe Ready for Hillary's fundraising progress.,,"Hillary Clinton join Democratic challenger for Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Penn. on Oct. 9, 2014.
Ready for Hillary, the quasi-official Clinton shadow campaign PAC, took in more than $2 million in the third quarter of the year, according to the group. That’s slightly less than the previous quarter as the group winds down its activities in anticipation of an official Clinton campaign launch.
The group has raised more than $10.25 million since it formed in early 2013, and raked in $2.5 million in the previous quarter.
Continuing to expand its grassroots fundraising base, Ready for Hillary brought more than 21,000 new donors into the fold over the past three months. Of its more than 38,000 contributions during the quarter, 98% were for less than $100. The average contribution was $52.
Ready for Hillary has always said it plans to “go out of business” if Clinton announces a second presidential run, which is likely to occur early next year. Most of the group’s staffers have fled its Arlington, Virginia headquarters to go work on Democratic midterm campaigns. But some version of the group could find a second life alongside an official campaign.
The group plans to convene several hundred of its largest donors in New York City after Election Day next month.
Organizing for Action, the grassroots nonprofit spinoff of the Obama campaign, is perhaps Ready for Hillary’s closet analog. It raised just $1.8 million over the same time period, though the group said it was scaling back fundraising to avoid sapping money from midterm candidates.
Some new large contributors to the Ready for Hillary include Obama donor Sandra Bainum, Detroit lawyer David Page, and Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux, the wife of video game entrepreneur Richard Garriott. Each gave the group a $25,000 contribution, maxing out its self-imposed donor cap.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Introducing... the [introductory-programming] tag cleanup!

The idea of teaching programming to beginners in pretty simple. But it's the simplest ideas that are most heavily abused. In that spirit, I think we need to monitor the most used tag on the site: introductory-programming. Let's get it cleaned up!
Here is a list of candidates for retagging/tag removal. Anything that has been on this list for a week without objection can and will be retagged. Please only do this retagging if you have the editing privilege so as not to clog up the suggested edits queue. Also, space out edits to keep the home page (relatively) normal.
Feel free to answer this question with objections to this retag effort or to specific questions being retagged. I'd like for a mod to make this post community wiki so that anyone can edit this list, and so it can remain updated and useful. Until then, edit the normal way.
This list should be in the format of:

Question Title (as link) - Date Added to List (UTC) - Why question was added to list

""[DISPUTED]"" Should be put before the question link if there is anyone who disputes the question being retagged. That should also link to an answer to this question disputing the retag.

Do you see the “Bimodal Distribution” too? - 6/21/2017 UTC -  This has no relation to the level of programmers involved in the class. Presumably most CS classes display this ""Bimodal Distribution"", and if the question is specially about beginners, it needs to be edited.
How can I incorporate agile development into CS1/CS2 courses? - 6/21/2017 UTC - Agile could be integrated into any level course. This isn't even specific to an intro to agile. This could be applied to a class for developers experienced in agile.
Significant algorithm from CS for DrRacket that emphasize cons, car, and cdr - 6/21/2017 UTC - This isn't about introducing students to anything, it's about generating an example to show students, which could be relevant at any point in a curriculum.
Assessing programming skills of students under 18 years - 6/21/2017 UTC - The question of assessing a students skills is relevant to any level of student, not specifically students in an introductory course.
Excel macro recorder exercises - 6/21/2017 - Even in the question, it's mentioned that it's for both beginner and advanced classes.
Effectiveness of Parsons Problems - 6/21/2017 - Why are parsons problems specifically relevant to intro classes? It seems like parsons problems could be used anywhere. The answers do seem to be targeted towards beginners though...
Do automatic style hints help students to understand the language they're learning? - 6/21/2017 - A students use of linters and other style tools should be equally impactful regardless of level. Students are more impressionable when they're younger, but that's not a strong enough reason to have the tag.

Update
### Please DO NOT apply the edits until this notice is removed.
The affected questions, and proposed/applied changes, are being tracked in this Google Sheets spreadsheet.

A:

This concept was discussed in chat, and the conclusion that we came to is that intoductory-programming must die!
We said that introductory programming must die because based on the name, it isn't clear what the tag is referring to. We agreed that the meaning of the tag should be for lessons introducing new concepts, and so the tag should be introductory-lesson rather than introductory-programming. This could also help with people typing ""programming"" into the tag field and selecting the first option. As it was most elequently phrased:

So introductory-lesson instead of what we have now for the questions about introducing something in a specific lesson? - Itamar Green

Source
What is the procedure we suggest to fix it?
We'd have to wait until we have moderators to actually implement this fix, but we should have moderators relatively soon.
We should manually go through the questions, a few a day, and handle those as needed. This would also have the benefit of bumping a few questions to the front every day, which should help to improve quality across the site as more people will take a look at these older questions.",,"As of this posting there are 34 questions on introductory-programming list. Having read them, and considered what can be done with them, I've compiled my thoughts for all of them. The main premise being that introductory-programming will die, and therefore, be removed from all of them. I've also identified the few, in my view, that might fit in the proposed introductory-lesson tag. They are listed in oldest-first order, in view of the proposal to process them that way. A few also are covered by other tag edit proposals, and are so noted.
Let the games begin.

Using Processing as an entry point in an Introductory Course: 
Answers: 4.
Suggestion:
OP is gathering data to develop a new curriculum. The needed tag is  curriculum-design. Not entirely sure that processing belongs either, it's one possibility for the new courses, but not the only. I think the Processing component of the question is part of an X-Y issue. Answers should be driven by how to evaluate any language for the classroom and course objectives, not just one. Otherwise we end up with the same OP asking the same question with a different language until he finds the one that fits. With generic evaluation guidelines, the answer allows OP to evaluate Processing now, and other languages later, until one does meet his needs.
Should assembly language be taught in an introductory course (or soon after)?: 
Answers: 11.
Suggestion: This one just needs the introductory-programming dropped.
How can I convey the idea of a programming language vs. a markup language?: 
Answers: 8.
Suggestion: This one might need lesson-ideas but the introductory-programming.
When teaching Web Development, should server or client side come first?:
Answers: 4.
Suggestion: For this one programming doesn't even apply to the question. It's about a choice of where to start in presenting the entire web stack. The other tags belong, the introductory-programming is a positive drop..
Recommended IDE for teaching web development to beginners
Answers: 9.
Suggestion: Add ide.
Using microcontrollers in an Introductory course
Answers: 2.
Suggestion:
Possibly add engagement
Do automatic style hints help students to understand the language they're learning?
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
Maybe add ide, or create linters. Don't think undergraduate is appropriate, and even functional-programming is questionable. Not sure what's in best practices for CS classrooms, but that might apply. code-style is tangential and might be appropriate here as well.
Should I have written tests on basic programming skills?
Answers: 6.
Suggestion:
Another good place to add the assessment tag, and seems like it could use differentiation as well.
How can I teach introduce modern web development in an introductory programming course
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
Also drop language-choice as not in the question at all. Probably retag with curriculum-design
Explaining basic html structure
Answers: 8.
Suggestion:
lesson-ideas might apply to. This is one of the few candidates for the proposed introductory-lesson tag
Database theory (normalization) for beginners (adult education, MS Access)
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
Drop and run
Programming languages specifically designed for beginners
Answers: 11.
Suggestion:
This one almost justifies the tag. Can't think of anything better to add though. Language choice is the real subject of the questions anyway.
How can I maintain interest in front end?

Suggestion:
This one really is engagement, as it already has.
Programming curriculum for senior students (over 50 years)
Answers: 6.
Suggestion:
This situation is not much different from some undergrad choosing to switch from a fine arts major to a CS major; using the computer is understood, understanding the computer, or programming it is a whole different story
Effectiveness of Parsons Problems

Suggestion:
lesson-ideas is enough for this one.
What makes imperative programming easier or harder to learn?
Answers: 2.
Suggestion:
Seems that best-practices would be a possible fit here as well.
Assignments for Introductory Level Processing
Answers: 3.
Suggestion:
Could add lesson-ideas to this.
What program follows “hello, world”?
Answers: 8.
Suggestion:
Maybe could add lesson-ideas to this. Though the OP mentions scaffolding it seems this might be a candidate for the proposed introductory-lesson tag.
Excel macro recorder exercises
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
Drop adult-education as well and add lesson-ideas and it seems this might be a candidate for the proposed introductory-lesson tag as well.
Assessing programming skills of students under 18 years
Answers: 2.
Suggestion:
Add (create) student-assessment or skill-assessment or placement-tests.
Significant algorithm from CS for DrRacket that emphasize cons, car, and cdr
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
introductory-programming is out of place here anyway. Introducing new concepts, yes, but not introducing programming. Could add lesson-ideas now that we have that available. It seems this would be a good candidate for the proposed introductory-lesson tag.
How can I show the value of best practices?
Answers: 6.
Suggestion:
Need to also drop best-practices now that it's been established that on CSE best-practices is about the educational concepts related to classroom management, etc. called best practices by educators, and not coding best practices. Note: This is also in the proposed merge from coding-conventions to coding-style
Demographics in Programming Teams in Early CS Courses
Answers: 2.
Suggestion:
Possible use for best-practices as well. Note: This is also in the proposed switch from group-assignment to group-work
How to respond when students ask “is recursion good practice”?
Answers: 9.
Suggestion:
engagement and/or student-motivation seems proper here, probably lesson-ideas as well. It seems this might be a candidate for the proposed introductory-lesson tag.
How can I incorporate agile development into CS1/CS2 courses?
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
Drop and run
How to teach students not to use jump statements
Answers: 6.
Suggestion:
For better minds than mine to debate, but maybe best-practices applies here, as in educational goals served by ""forgetting about jump statements altogether."" Otherwise it's a good candidate for curriculum-design. Note: This is also in the proposed merge from coding-conventions to coding-style
Teaching identifier naming conventions
Answers: 3.
Suggestion:
Good candidate for adding coding-style as well.
The importance of writing understandable code Duplicate
Answers: 4.
Suggestion:
Drop and run, except that Note: This is also in the proposed merge from coding-conventions to coding-style
Justification for an objects-early approach to introductory programming

Thoughts on copying and pasting code?
Answers: 5.
Suggestion:
Never was ""introductory"" as it applies from day one to graduation. Does fit in best-practices however, I think. Or, maybe classroom-management, but that might be a stretch.
What would be a good first choice to teach game programming to beginners?
Answers: 4.
Suggestion:
language-choice applies here.
How is your teaching affected by how you learned?
Answers: 1.
Suggestion:
I don't see adult-learning for this one, nor do I see self-learning being applicable to the question. It applies to OP, but not the question. best-practices might be a better fit. As a side note, the title seems to be at odds with the bulk of the question's text, which seems to be mostly about finding student motivation. OP even admits that while he's self-taught his co-instructor seems not to be. The final two sentences (questions?) do match the title. Frankly, this one might benefit from a little more TLC.
Do you see the “Bimodal Distribution” too?
Answers: 2.
Suggestion:
In spite of the title engagement applies, and maybe student-motivation as well. Better minds than mine can address whether or not best-practices belongs here, though I suspect it does.
Should unit testing be taught in introductory programming classes? 4 close votes
Answers: 3.
Suggestion:
I'd add curriculum-design to this one. As an extra warning: This one won't be easy to change. It has had the tag removed once already, and the OP recovered it 2017-06-21 21:52:12Z noting ""Added intro-programming tag"" for revision #4.",,akoksal/LongForm

"How can I remove my dryer's lint filter without creating a mess?

My new dryer has a large lint filter on the top. When I remove it, lint and dust fall off the filter onto the top of the dryer, and the dust floats off into the air as well.
In the second picture below, you can see the black dust on top of the dryer.

How can I remove the lint trap cleanly? Please no solutions that involve cleaning up the dust afterwards. I refuse to believe dryers of this type were designed so badly that they always make a mess.",,"Several things come to mind.
Put something under the filter to catch the falling dust, a piece of cloth will do, as will a sheet of paper like a part of a page of a news paper.
Have your vacuum cleaner running with its tube as its soft or hard tubular end and hold the end next to or under the filter when you lift it out.
If you can not do it at the same time you can use the vacuum afterwards to clean off the dust without it going all over.
And an other option might be to clean your dust catcher less often, (read instructions on your dryer before you try this) as the longer period will give a thicker dust layer on the filter, which does not fall apart so readily.",,akoksal/LongForm

"Story: Barney was excited as he prepared for bed. After all, tomorrow was his favorite day of the year. For some people, it was Christmas or their birthday, but not Barney, for him, it was always April 1. He loved April Fool’s Day as he loved to play elaborate pranks on everyone that he knew. As he prepared for bed, he thought of all his planned pranks he was going to pull off tomorrow and he could hardly wait. Tomorrow was going to be a good day indeed. As he lay in bed, Barney seemed to be having the strangest of dreams. He thought he heard someone in his bedroom and then smelled ether. Then he dreamed that he was being carried out of his house and put into a car or a truck. What was strange was that he almost felt like he was living the dream, but he was not waking up. Then in his dream, he was carried somewhere and placed on a hard surface where he lay for a while. The last part of the dream was the strangest. He felt like he was moving and heard a constant clackity-clack almost like a train going over the tracks. The dream finally ended when he heard a cell phone ringing and woke up. That was when Barney realized that it was not a strange dream, but that somehow, he was sitting in a boxcar on a moving train. Meanwhile, the cell phone kept ringing, so Barney finally answered it. The voice on the other end was his good friend Fred. “Barney, you may be wondering why you are in a boxcar on a moving train. This is a payback from everyone in your life on whom you have played April Fool’s jokes over the years. We decided that it was time to play one on you. Here is what is happening. You were placed on a train that left New York City this morning at 3:00 am. The train will arrive at its destination at 10:00 am. You have until that time to determine where you are. There are five choices, with a corresponding phone number programmed into this cell phone. By 10 am, you need to call one of the five listed phone numbers. If you get the right answer and call the right number, the door to the boxcar will automatically open and you can get out. There will be a driver there ready to take you to breakfast and then take you home. However, if you dial the wrong number or if you fail to call a number by 10:00 am, you open the latch on the crate at the other end of the boxcar. In that crate are several skunks. You will then have to spend the rest of the day with the skunks. We have ensured that there are clues that will allow you to solve this mystery if you pay attention. Good luck and APRIL FOOL’s.” With that, Fred hung up. Barney was impressed that his friends would go to such great lengths. First, he tried to get his bearings. He was seated with his back up against one wall of the boxcar. From the direction of the motion, he could tell that he was facing in the direction that the train was traveling, so he was in the back of the boxcar. It was just getting light out, so he was able to see into the rest of the boxcar. Up ahead, he could see a large crate with what looked to be a clock on the top of it. That was probably the crate of skunks. He knew his friends and so he believed that they really would release a bunch of skunks into his boxcar if he did not solve the mystery. There was a chair on each side of the boxcar. The chairs were positioned so that by sitting in them, it would be possible to look out a small hole and see outside. There seemed to be something on the floor to the right of the crate, but he could not make it out as it was in the shadow of the crate. He would explore that later. Barney knew that he needed to get started, so he got up and walked to the first chair. There he saw the note taped above the wall. It said: 
Here are the potential destinations: 
Philadelphia, PA: 94 miles Boston, MA: 216 miles Washington, DC: 229 miles Pittsburgh, PA: 339 miles Raleigh, NC: 511 miles Barney figured it was time to start looking out the peephole, so he sat down and looked out the left side. There was not much to see. Smack dab in the middle of suburbia. He could be anywhere. After a while, the train ran alongside a highway. Barney thought that if he could see all the license plates that he could figure out what state he was in. However, the cars were all going much faster than the train so he could not read the license plates. He tried watching for a little longer in the hopes he would see a highway sign, but no such luck. After a while, he decided to try the other side. As he looked out the right side of the train, Barney saw much the same things as he saw on the left side of the train. At least the scenery was a little better on this side. This side had much more greenery and was much more pleasant to look at. Maybe he would be able to find a clue from this side, so he just kept watching. After a while, a park came into view. In addition to the standard pavilions and ponds, there was a small statue of someone. Barney strained to see who it was, but alas, no luck. He was about to give up when the train came upon a biking trail. Barney tried to yell out to the people who were riding their bikes along the train, asking where he was but each time he yelled to someone, the train was well past them before they could answer back. Obviously, that was not going to help. Barney looked at the timer. He had ten minutes left to come up with an answer. Barney got up and started to pace when he stepped on something to the right of the crate; looking down, he noticed his three juggling balls. Fred obviously put them here knowing that when he truly needed to solve a problem, he always juggled. There was something about juggling these three rubber balls that allowed him to focus on a problem. Fortunately the balls had stayed here at the front of the boxcar during the entire trip. Reaching down to pick them up, he thought ""don’t fail me now"" as he started juggling. With just a minute left as the train was coming to a stop, the balls did the trick. He knew just where he was. Quickly he pulled the phone out of his pocket. Taking a deep breath of fresh air just in case, he dialed the number with thoughts of skunks running through his mind. Where is Barney?",,"Fred answered the phone and laughed. “So, you figured it out.” “Of course I did,” said Barney. “As you said, the clues were all there, I just had to figure them out. The first clue was the shadows cast by the crate of skunks. The shadow was on the right of the crate, which meant that the sun was to the left of the train. It was the morning, so the sun had risen in the East. Therefore, we had to be going south. That eliminated Boston. It did not totally eliminate Pittsburgh, as that is somewhat south of New York. Next, the train was traveling for seven hours. The cars on the highway were passing the train easily, so the train had to be going less than 60 miles an hour. Thus, the total distance had to be less than 420 miles. That eliminated Raleigh. Since most people ride bikes at about 10 or 15 mph and the train passed them easily, I knew we traveled more than 105 miles, which eliminated Philadelphia. The question then was Washington, DC or Pittsburgh. The juggling balls were the answer. While the path from New York to Washington is pretty flat, Pittsburgh is on the other side of the Allegheny Mountains.

"As a beginner in do a toe touch, what are the 15 basic steps I should take?",,"1. Reach up and wide in a high ""V,"" or clasp your hands straight above your shoulders. Prepare to swing your arms down for momentum. This motion should build the power that you need to jump higher.
You can also start by holding your hands together in front of your chest. If you are performing the toe touch as part of a routine, however, it'll make most sense to swing your arms up first.
2. Bring your hands together in one smooth motion, straight out in front of your body. Bend your knees into a slight crouch. Rest your weight on the balls of your feet, as a springboard for the jump. Clench your fists and let them hang down before your knees – ready to swing back up.
3. Swing your arms up and out into a ""T"" position at your sides. Try to ""snap"" sharply into shape; the motion should be tight and precise, not fluid and loose. Your arms should form a crisp angle: straight out from the shoulders, perfectly parallel to the ground, and perpendicular to your torso. Keep your fists clenched. As you form the ""T,"" begin to rise up out of your half-crouch.
You may be told to lower your arms in order to bring your legs higher. Don't bother. It will just make your form look sloppy.
4. As your arms reach the level of the ""T,"" use the momentum of the arm swing to burst up into the air. Jump off of the balls of your feet, and keep your toes pointed. Try to make the leap a fluid motion: from crouch to ""T"" to jump.
5. As soon as you leave the ground, swing your feet out wide. Roll your hips backward to expose your inner thighs. Try to bring your feet slightly higher than your hips.
The rolling motion may happen naturally, but noticing the way that it feels might help you gain more control over your technique.
6. At the same time as you spread your legs, reach your arms out toward your toes. Bend forward slightly, if that helps. Don't worry about actually touching your toes – just reach down your legs as far as you can. At the ""top"" or zenith of the toe touch jump, you should reach perfect toe-touching form.
7. From the top of your jump, snap your arms and legs back together as you begin to fall to the ground. Land with your feet together, your knees slightly bent, your back straight, your fists held in front of your knees, and your arms extended fully forward. Hold this position for a moment, then stand up straight. You have completed a toe touch!
8. If you have access to resistance bands, wrap these loose rubber loops around your ankles as you work on your toe touch. Then, try to perform your toe touches as normal. It will be much harder to fully extend your legs. However, the bands will bring your legs back together more quickly once they're spread, which might help you perfect the sharp ""snapping"" motion. As an added bonus, this should strengthen your legs.
9. If you are going to be doing a toe touch as part of a cheerleading or gymnastics routine, you'll probably need to do it to the beat of a song. Try giving each ""position"" of the toe touch a number from one through eight. On 1 and 2, keep your hands clasped in front of you; on 3, swing into the 'high ""V""' pose, and hold it through 4; on 5, snap down into the crouch; on 6, begin your jump and swing your arms into the ""T""; on 7, hit the peak of your jump; and land on the count of 8.

Listen to a short section of the song on loop, and try to figure out the tempo – the number of beats per minute (BPM). Count to eight in your head as the song loops: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Try to reach each position of the toe touch in time with the beat of the song.
Even if you aren't doing a toe touch to a song, the act of counting might help you space out the movements. Practice counting in your head until you do not need to think about the numbers separately from the positions.
10. The best way to improve is to practice regularly. Stretch before and after to build strength and flexibility. Make sure that you have plenty of room to perform the full jump!
Consider practicing the move in front of a mirror so that you can analyze and improve your form. Otherwise, try working on your form with a partner, for feedback – perhaps a coach, a friend, or another member of your gymnastics/cheer team.
11. In order to execute this standard gymnastic move, you'll need to swing your arms down and bend your legs into a crouch, then spring up into the air with a sharp motion. You will extend your arms in a ""T,"" and you will spread and raise your legs in a sort of aerial ""splits."" You'll reach toward your toes, but you don't need to actually touch them. Beyond practicing the move itself, you can prepare for a successful toe touch by stretching all of the muscles and tendons that you will use: your quads, your calves, your back, your arms, your shoulders.
12. This basic stretch is sometimes referred to as a ""toe touch"" as well, and it is a great way to prepare yourself for the cheerleading ""toe touch"" move. Start by standing with your feet together, your back straight, and your hands hanging loosely at your sides. Bend forward at the waist, and reach your hands down toward your toes. Reach as far as you can, then hold your arms and hands steady where they fall. Gradually bend and unbend at the waist, reaching further down each time, until you can touch your toes.

Be sure to keep your knees straight. Bending your knees will make it easier to touch your toes, but it won't help you build flexibility.
You may not be able to touch your toes on the first day, or at all. Everyone's body is different. Even if you can't physically touch your toes, however, the act of reaching further and further toward the ground should improve your flexibility.
13. Dynamic stretching is one of the best ways to prepare for an active move like the toe touch. Jumping jacks are relatively easy to do, and they simulate some of the motions that you'll go through as you execute your toe touch. Try to snap sharply through the jumping jacks – you want to be tight and precise, not loose and sloppy.
14. Sit on the ground with your legs out in front of you. Then, slowly spread your legs into a ""V,"" as far as they will go without lifting them from the ground. Gently reach your arms down toward one foot, and lean into the stretch as far as feels comfortable. Touch your toe and hold it for 10-60 seconds. Then, straighten back up and repeat with the other foot.
After you've stretched each side, try bending your torso forward and extending your arms down the center of the leg ""V."" Then, try bending forward with one arm reaching down each leg. Hold and repeat these poses until you no longer feel tight.
15. You'll need to rotate your hips backward as you jump in order to spread your legs in the way you want. Build strength in your hip joints before you try to toe touch to reduce the risk of pulling a muscle. Sit on the ground with your legs spread and your back straight, and place one hand by each knee. Then, point your toes and raise your legs a few inches off of the ground.

Do not hold this stretch for long. Lift your legs, then lower them – then lift them again, then lower them. Perform 10 repetitions of the lift-lower cycle, then give yourself a short break before continuing.
Work your hip flexors every couple of days to build power and flexibility. This is one of the most important motions that you'll need for your toe touch. Take it seriously!

"Area 51 Statistics

Let's go through this from best to worst:

100% answered - excellent: Need I say more? We've answered every question.
Around 4.2 answers a question - excellent. So we're kind of rocking the answers. 
48 avid users, 1,255 total users - okay (on pace for 80 200+ rep users, 3 2000+, and 3 3000+). So, we're not bad here - but we could use more users. We've posted ads on other sites, have a twitter account, and people are emailing those they know to spread the word. Plus, it's summer, so this number will likely get a boost come September. It's important, of course, to encourage people who come to stay, and I think this community is very welcoming, so that shouldn't be a big problem =)
1,177 visits per day - okay - this got a big boost since the last time I checked it. We're not that far from the ""good"" mark! I think it helps that we've gotten quite a few hot network questions (HNQs) recently - so upvote good questions when you see them!
4 questions per day - needs work - okay, so we've got a bit to go on this one. We should get around 6 more questions a day. So first, I'd encourage the current regulars to ask questions when you've got them - but also, this will increase as more users join and site views increase.

We're thirty days in. I think we can reach all of these goals at ninety days. What do you all think?",,"I've done some (very basic) comparsion of 15 beta sites using this data dump to find out how good our statistics are compared to the ones of other sites.

Number of questions per day: We're above the average amount and in the top 3 sites. No site in the dump reaches the ""Excellent"" threshold though.
The number of questions per day still needs work. As Robert Cartaino has stated in their answer to a question about the chances of success for this site, it's important to note that 

[...] having the same people ask more questions is not sustainable and not a solution [...]

As he continues, he points out that we should focus on getting more users to increase the number of questions per day.
Percentage answered: Everything fine, excellent work!
Avid users: Only at about ${1}\over{3}$ of the ""Excellent"" threshold, you might interpret the data as a slight increase over time in beta, but I'm not sure.
Total users: About $0.6$ times of the average user count (I think this is good nevertheless as we managed to get those users quite quickly).
Answer ratio: In my view, our answer ratio is absolutely awesome ;) - the only ratio rated ""Excellent"" in the dump by the way. Even if the ratio drops by $1.8$ questions, it would still be ""Excellent"".
Visits per day: Compared to time, this is also amazing, I think. We are one out of three sites rated ""Okay"" and approaching ""Excellent"", the other two sites rated ""Okay"" have been in beta for around 200 and 400 days.

I think that in the following month (when this site continues to be established), the visits per day will increase. I think it's likely that the amount of visits per day will be ""Excellent"" by the end of the 90 day period.
Concerning users and therefore the number questions per day, I'm also waiting for the end of summer to see both numbers increasing. 
Due to our high answer ratio, we have also often made questions get it into the Hot Network Questions, which are displayed on a sidebar on most sites of the Stack Exchange network. This, of course, helps us to gain more attention and is therefore a good way to get more users.

Need temperature for 24 hours for each county of United States. Average values is ok, seasonal granularity welcome. I've been looking at nClimDiv datasets ",,"You can get this from the Integrated Surface Dataset (ISD).
First get a list of all weather stations from ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.txt:

                           dtype={""WBAN"": ""O""})

Then select the ones in the USA:
stations_us = stations[stations[""CTRY""]==""US""]

That give us 7326 stations.  Although the state of each station is described, the county is not.  To get the county you will need to combine the lat/lon for each station with a county database.  That is a bit beyond the scope of Earth Science SE, but maybe you can get help at GIS SE.  The station ID is a combination of two fields:
ids = stations_us[""USAF""] + stations_us[""WBAN""]

We can then download the measurements for a particular year from AWS S3:
meas = pandas.read_csv(f""s3://noaa-global-hourly-pds/2020/{ids.iloc[200]:s}.csv"", parse_dates=[""DATE""])

And extract temperatures:
temps = meas.TMP.str.extract(r""([+-]\d{4}),([012345679ACIMPRU])"")[0].astype(""f4"")/10

Let's get the valid ones (there's a 9999 fill value) and plot:
valid = temps<999
meas[valid].set_index(meas.DATE[valid])[""temps""].plot()

Generally, that is bad design. Servers and clients should be able to reside in different subnets.
If you scatter 192.168.33.0/24 across several sites you'll need to use L2VPN - L2 tunneling over WAN is a general problem and should be avoided wherever possible.
I'd seriously advise on exploring a distributed setup with the software vendor/support. Only if they tell you that that's impossible should you consider L2 tunneling. You must be aware that a L2 tunnel over WAN doesn't have the same reliability as a local link.

"What's been going on with the IndyCar teams during the testing from ISM Raceway in Avondale, Arizona? Respond in 28 sentences.",,"After a full day of IndyCar testing from ISM Raceway in Avondale, Arizona, there were a slew of various reactions up and down the pit lane.
The implementation of a new universal aero kit on the Dallara IR-12 chassis currently being used in IndyCar competition has received rave reviews after testing the car at road courses such as Sebring International Raceway and Sonoma Raceway. This was the first time that the full field of IndyCar teams had gotten the opportunity to put the UAK through its paces on a short oval – and there were certainly some growing pains.
While Dale Coyne Racing has been building momentum with various announcements made over the past two weeks, it was a challenging day for their four-time Champ Car World Series champion, Sebastien Bourdais, on Friday.
Much happier with their results, the Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing duo of Graham Rahal and Takuma Sato finished each of the two practice sessions in the top six on one-lap speeds, and recorded a 1-2 finish to the final session on Friday evening. Emerging from under the previous Honda aero kit and its deficiencies on short ovals, Rahal had nothing but positive words after a day of running.
Graham Rahal had a quick day in his No. 15 United Rentals Honda, finishing in the top six of each practice session.
Rahal and Sato were the only drivers to post a lap averaging 189 miles per hour on the 1.022-mile oval on day one, with times of 19.457 and 19.460 respectively.
For Andretti Autosport rookie Zach Veach, it was his first opportunity to drive an IndyCar on a short oval. The 23-year-old driver has been trying to absorb all the information he possibly can – though even his team understands that there will be much to learn over the course of the 2018 season.
“My engineer said it best when he said I’m retaining about 60% of the information right now,” laughed Veach. “It’s like drinking from a fire hose.
The former Advance Auto Parts INDYCAR Radio Network reporter did have some useful insight to add following a day’s worth of practice at ISM Raceway. In describing the car, he utilized analysis from his three teammates to build his own baseline before taking to the track. After that, he could relate the car’s performance to his own previous experience.
“The track is really fast and my teammates have told me the car is quite a bit lighter from last year’s,” Veach said. “It feels like the same amount of grip as an Indy Lights car, but we’re going 20 to 30 mph faster. We’ve had a great start to the test with the rookie test yesterday and the session this afternoon.
Veach shouldn’t feel too bad knowing he doesn’t have as much in his notebook to pull from. Veterans like Scott Dixon and James Hinchcliffe have come to the realization that there aren’t too many characteristics of previous setups that will translate to this new universal aero kit.
Even the four-time champion, Scott Dixon, was left starting from scratch with the new universal aero kit on Friday.
“There are a lot of unknowns here with the new car to be honest. We are trying to do a lot of things and go through a lot of changes to understand this car,” Dixon, a four-time champion, explained.
For Hinchcliffe, it was somewhat of a surprise that teams will be able to utilize so little of the information that they had compiled in previous seasons driving the Dallara IR-12 chassis.
“I don’t really know what we expected (from Friday), obviously everything is so new,” said Hinchcliffe. “It’s funny how for the same fundamental car – the chassis is the same, the suspension’s all the same, all the rest of it – how much just a change in the bodywork can affect the setups, what you need to do, and what the car likes, how it behaves.

Explain the findings of a poll conducted in July 2018 on approval ratings for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.,,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday that Ottawa will index the Canada Child Benefit to inflation two years earlier than expected.
As the weather gets warmer, Canadians are also warming back up to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals — with their approval rating jumping by five points this month.
According to an exclusive Ipsos poll for Global News, 55 per cent of Canadian respondents approve of Justin Trudeau’s government, up from 50 per cent in June.
It’s also a marked rise since its lowest point; only 44 per cent of respondents approved of him at the end of March.
If a vote were held today, the Liberals would receive 39 per cent of the popular vote, the poll found — up six points since last month — with the Tories coming in second with 32 per cent of the vote, a drop of five points since last month.
The NDP remains unchanged with 21 per cent of the vote, the bloc Quebecois is down one point to two per cent of the vote, and all others, including the Green Party, would receive six per cent of the vote — up one point.
Pollster Mike Colledge, president of Ipsos Canada public affairs, explained the uptick in approval has to do with the timing — Canadians are rallying around Trudeau after public disagreements with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, and Trudeau responded by slapping retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth $16 billion.
Colledge said it’s one of those rare issues where we’ve seen even Doug Ford line up behind Mr. Trudeau and say this is the right approach.
Another key factor is the lack of media attention on Trudeau’s opponents.
“During summer, the House of Commons breaks and it takes away some of the oxygen from the opposition parties in terms of their ability to get media attention around key issues,” he explained.
The shift is mirrored in key demographic groups including women, men, Millennials, Gen Xers, and in every income category.
Support for Conservatives remains strong among those 55 years of age and older.
Across the country, the Liberals lead in ever province except the Prairies. Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta all favour the Conservatives.
“It’s probably a little bit of both,” he explained.
Colledge also clarified that the poll was done before Trudeau announced his cabinet shakeup on Wednesday.
These are some of the findings of an Ipsos poll conducted between July 13 and 16, 2018, on behalf of Global News. For this survey, a sample of 1,000 people was interviewed. Weighting was then employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample’s composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The poll is accurate to within ±3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Canadian adults been polled.",,akoksal/LongForm

"Why a question about language identification is not valid?

I asked this question: https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/7245/what-is-the-language-shown-in-the-image-please-help-me-identify-it at Linguistics Stack Exchange
Some people closed it as off-topic. My question is why this is off-topic? The site description says:

Linguistics Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for
  professional linguists and others with an interest in linguistic
  research and theory.

So I think this is a research on language question. That satisfies above definition of the website.

A:

Writing systems and orthography are definitely aspects of linguistics. Linguists at Language Log occasionally discuss these issues (eg. 1, 2). Here too, questions such as ""Please help me identify this language (image)"" get attention and votes.
Though I did not vote (up or down) either of these questions or their answers, I tend to favour the inclusion of questions about language identification. However, I don't think posting graffiti would be useful to the community at large: graffiti tends to by highly stylized (read ""arbitrary""), and not really representative of how a language is written.",,"In short, it doesn't seem to me to be a question about linguistics.  The Help Center specifically calls out translation-request questions as off-topic, and in general ""identify this thing"" questions aren't very good ones for Stack Exchange anyway.

"""What do we know so far about the upcoming Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon?""",,"The latest edition of Japanese gaming publication Famitsu has divulged some more information about the upcoming Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon for the Nintendo 3DS. The information has been translated by NeoGAF member sinonobu. Enjoy!
Not a sequel to S/M but the story with “different divergence”.
The appearance of Ultra Recon Squad will change the story.
Main Story with different development and there’s a new post game content after beating Pokemon League.
People who are expecting minor changes like “Emerald” or “Platinum” should be expecting “Ultra Change”.
There’s new game content where players can roam around the Ultra Hole and go to different dimensions.
Capturing and raising Pokemon became easier compared S/M.
In some of the dimensions that players go through “Ultra Warp Ride”, players will be able to encounter some Legendary Pokemons. One of the Pokemons player can encounter is Mewtwo.
If one just compares the sheer length of the script, US/UM is twice as long compared to Sun and Moon.
“USUM’s script is twice as long”. Oh please make it possible to skip through dialogue for those who want to do more playthroughs like nuzlockes….
Mewtwo, the mightiest Legendary Pokémon, has returned! OH YES! Hope he gives a tough battle, makes it more satisfying when I catch him!
Actually, Mewtwo is average in stats, because of the later generations, but Mega Mewtwo Y & X are the mightiest Pokémon…..until Arceus gets a Mega Evolution.
Why, because this article used their GBA sprites?
Sounds like theyre doing what they did in ORAS with encountering legendary pokemon. Cant wait.
But can you trade the new UBs over to 2016’s Sun & Moon? I’m going to be on this until they confirm.
Because Wonder Trade is a thing, and they are of same generation.
i just hopw they thought to add some new alohlan pokemon forms or just new pokemon.
Can we expect a Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 series VS Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood where the story is roughly the same til a certain point then the story splits into an alternate path? As long as the split isn’t too far into the game, I could potentially enjoy the Ultra versions as much as I enjoyed the originals if not more so.",,akoksal/LongForm

List 18 instructions to jailbreak a 2nd generation ipod touch.,,"1. Back up your device.: Jailbreaking can create problems, so it's a good idea to back up your device before attempting to jailbreak it. To do this:

Connect the iPod to your computer.
Launch iTunes. Select your iPod.
Under Manually Back Up and Restore, select Back Up Now.
2. Determine your model and operating system.: The jailbreak process will vary slightly with different software, and you may need to know your specific model and the operating system it's running. On your iPod, select Settings > General > About. Under Version, it will tell you what firmware you're running and the model in brackets.

An iPod Touch 2G will likely be operating iOS 4.2.1 or 4.1, but it's possible that it may be running something from iOS 3.
The model should either be MC or MB.
3. Prepare your device.: Have your device ready by keeping it on, locked, and not connected to your computer.
4. Download jailbreaking software on your computer.: Some of the most popular programs for jailbreaking an iPod Touch 2G are limera1n (Limerain), Redsn0w (Redsnow), and GreenPois0n (GreenPoison), which can be downloaded from Guide My Jailbreak.

Note that Redsn0w is compatible with iOS 4.2.1 and the MB model of the iPod Touch 2G only. If you are running a different iOS or have the MC model, you will have to use different software.

Make sure you download the appropriate version depending on whether you're using Mac or PC.
5. Open Limera1n on your computer.: After downloading Limera1n, open the file and run the software if you are prompted (on a PC).
6. Plug in your iPod.: When prompted, select Make It Rain. Your iPod will then enter recovery mode.
7. Hold down the sleep and home buttons.: The sleep/power button can be found on the top of the iPod, and the home button is the center button. Hold them both at the same time.
Be sure to watch your desktop during the process, as the Limera1n program will provide you with prompts.
8. Let go of the buttons.: When the Limera1n program prompts you, release the sleep and home buttons. Your iPod will now enter DFU (device firmware upgrade) mode. Select OK on your computer, and your device will restart. When it reboots, the jailbreak process will be complete.
9. Open Redsn0w on your computer.: After downloading Redsn0w, open the file and run the software if you are prompted (on a PC). Remember Redsn0w will only work with iOS 4.2.1 and an iPod Touch 2G that isn't the MC  model.
Make sure your device is turned on and not plugged in.
10. Download the firmware on your computer.: To jailbreak your iPod using Redsn0w, you will have to supply your computer with information from the iOS you're running. You can download it from here.
11. Open the firmware folder.: When you downloaded iOS 4.2.1 on your computer, it will have created a folder. Open that and select Browse. Find the firmware file, click Open > Next. Give it time to load.
12. Select your desired options.: When the box pops up for you to customize your installation options, make sure Install Cydia is checked, and check any other options you want as well. Click Next.
Cydia is essentially an app store for jailbroken Apple devices that you can use to purchase new applications and extensions. It gets installed on your device during the jailbreaking process.
13. Plug in your device.: Then, power it off by holding the sleep button and sliding it to power off. Keep your iPod in your hand and be ready to hold down some buttons.
14. Click Next on the desktop.: Immediately afterward, hold the sleep button on the iPod for three seconds. After three seconds, press down the home button while continuing to hold the sleep button. Hold the two simultaneously for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, release the sleep button, but continue holding the home button. Release the home button after eight seconds.
15. Allow the iPod to reboot.: Once it has restarted, check to see if Cydia has been downloaded onto your iPod. If it has, the jailbreak was successful. If it hasn't downloaded, repeat the process and try again.
16. Open GreenPois0n on your computer.: After downloading GreenPois0n, open the file and run the software if you are prompted (on a PC). When prompted with a question about Apple TV, click No. Plug in your iPod and power it off.
17. Hold the sleep button for three seconds.: Then, press down the home button while continuing to hold the sleep button. Hold the two simultaneously for 10 seconds. Release the sleep button, but continue holding the home button for another eight seconds.
18. Allow your iPod to enter DFU mode.: You can watch the jailbreak countdown on the computer. When it's finished, your iPod will restart and reboot, and when it does, the jailbreak process will be complete.

"Story: Autumn was in the air as Gary Patrick spoke to his advanced history students. It was week three of the fall term, and it was time to share an interesting story with them. Several of his students were familiar faces that had been in his basic class last spring. Gary was especially pleased that his two most gifted students from the spring term, Justin Miller and April Park, were with him again. He remembered how much they enjoyed hearing of his great-grandfather Tom Patrick’s experiences in a northern prison during the Civil War. Mr. Patrick also wondered if April would once again be able to solve the mystery he was about to put before her and the others in advanced history. At this moment, he was pleased he had decided to delay retirement for another year. Looking at April, Mr. Patrick said to his students, “I’m going to tell you a story. It is recent Patrick family history and a true story.” When he said this, he saw Justin’s eyes widen and an intense look cross April’s face, for they remembered well how interesting the story of Mr. Patrick’s great-grandfather was. The students sensed the upcoming drama and the classroom fell silent. Mr. Patrick continued, “The time is July, 1933. The place is Shawnee, Oklahoma. Those of you who were with me last year know that my great-grandparents Tom and Marie Patrick lived in London, Arkansas. After the Civil War, Tom’s brothers spread out to Oklahoma and Texas. This story is about my uncle John Patrick, who moved west to Oklahoma in the 1890’s and settled in an area of what became the city of Shawnee.” “My cousin Johnny Patrick still lives on the farm that Great Uncle John established just before the turn of the 20th century. It plays a major part in the story I am about to tell you.” “The 1930s were hard years for the United States but were particularly harsh for persons living in Oklahoma. The drought and high winds created what is known as the ‘Dust Bowl” and destroyed the crops and livelihood of many farmers, Uncle John included. The economic collapse created widespread distrust of banks and other financial institutions, for there were few government programs to insure assets or assist persons in need during that time. It took President Roosevelt’s New Deal awhile to get into full swing and in July of ’33, he had only been in office a short time.” Mr. Patrick paused, waiting for questions. There were none, so he continued, “Because of the public distrust many families, especially those living in rural communities on farms and homesteads, simply hid or buried things of value, even money, somewhere on their property. Even today, you will hear the occasional story of valuables being found unexpectedly on an old farm or residence. Hiding treasured belongings is what Uncle John did with just about everything of value he and Aunt Jean had during that hard first summer of the Roosevelt administration. He hid his assets and, like most persons of that era, did not tell anyone besides Aunt Jean he had done so.” “So, to the point of the story and the little puzzle I have for you. A couple of months ago Johnny decided to tear down the old barn. It was built in 1912 and was in pretty bad shape. In mid July, I traveled to Shawnee and spent several days helping him. One morning we discovered a tiny marker on the barn wall near the floor and in the far corner. It indicated that a metal box was buried just underneath the ground line underneath the floorboard at that spot. As you may imagine, we were intrigued and hurriedly ripped up the rotten wood flooring and quickly unearthed the box.” “The box was what old-timers used to call a ‘strongbox.’ It was obviously homemade and made entirely of steel with leather straps around it. As you may imagine, the straps were mostly rotten and the box itself was covered with rust, but otherwise it was in very good condition for something that had been in the ground for decades. We would soon find the contents of the box were dry and well preserved. It had a padlock on the hasp but both were so rusty that it took Johnny little effort to snap the lid open. When he did so, we found something of great value.” Mr. Patrick paused. This time, he did not continue until April asked, “What was in the box?” Mr. Patrick smiled, “That is the puzzle. I’m going to give you some clues and you will have to figure it out.” Mr. Patrick was pleased. He saw that he had the students’ full attention. He resumed by saying, “Now, let me back track a little bit. Tearing down the old barn was only part of a cleaning up project. Johnny and his wife Nance had been doing some remodeling in the main house as well. About a month before Johnny and I found the buried strongbox, Nance was cataloguing some old recipe books, which were kept on a shelf above the washer and dryer in the laundry room. Within one of those books was a yellowed piece of paper dated April 27, 1932. On this piece of paper was written a list of family valuables. The list included five items. The items were a diamond necklace, several pieces of paper Confederate States of America, (or CSA), currency, a rare lithograph photo of Tom and Marie Patrick, a money clip made of gold and a pistol encrusted with rubies and emeralds. Johnny said that the diamond necklace no doubt belonged to Jean and the other things were John’s. He thinks John got the pistol and money clip when traveling with a Wild West show in the early part of the century.” Justin asked, “Were all of the items found in the strongbox?” Mr. Patrick smiled and replied, “No, only one. That is the puzzle. When I finish the story, you should be able to figure out which item it was. Now, listen closely.” “After opening the strongbox, we took it inside the main house to the kitchen table for closer inspection. On the inside of the box lid the date, “May 4, 1932 was scratched. Evidently, Aunt Nance’s list detailed the items to be placed in the box Uncle John was making for the purpose of safekeeping. For some reason, only one of the items was found in the box. This was a mystery to both of us but over the course of the next few days we discovered why.” “The next day, Nance found one of the items in an old ice box in the main house basement. In those days, it was common for people to store paper documents such as stocks, bonds, legal papers, etc., in iceboxes and refrigerators to safeguard against fire.” Mr. Patrick was quietly amused when he noticed one of his new students about to say something but decided against it. He continued, “A couple of days later, in the middle of the morning Nance again found another of the valuables, this time in the library and in a hollowed out book on the top shelf. This was another common practice in those pre-World War II days. Normally, you would hide things, especially dangerous objects you wanted to keep away from children, inside such a modified work – and the bigger the book, the better! It helped if it was one of those large leather works with a small lock and key hasp on it, but then you would have to ruin a very expensive work of art and literature to use it as a makeshift safe.” Mr. Patrick paused to let his last statement sink in. After a moment, he continued, “That afternoon, the busy Nance found another of the items. It was found in a storage box, deep in the basement storage closet. With this item there was a lock of hair, a brooch and a hairbrush with a silver backing.” Looking at Justin and April, Mr. Patrick stated, “I believe we learned in one of our lessons last year that women of that era and before kept locks of hair as keepsakes with their other items of jewelry.” “Finally, just before I was to return home, Johnny and I cleaned out what appeared to be an unfinished room upstairs. When we were about half done, we realized it was not an unfinished bedroom but an abandoned walk-in closet. This was not too surprising as it sat right off of Uncle John’s study. The item in question was found in an inlaid box full of masculine accoutrements. Among other things, it contained a tobacco pouch, a cigar lighter and the usual assortment of suspender buttons and cuff links.” Mr. Patrick paused but resumed before any of his students could speak. He said, “I have given you four clues. You should be able to determine what was in the strongbox by process of elimination.” Mr. Patrick left the classroom for a few minutes. Before departing, he said, “I would expect you will have the correct answer when I return from the office.” What item was in the strongbox?",,"Mr. Patrick was pleased to see that it was neither April nor Justin who spoke first after he arrived back in the classroom. After asking his students, “Have you figured it out? Josh Ellis, one of his new students answered, “Yes!”

Smiling, Mr. Patrick replied, “Okay. Explain.”

“We’ll take turns offering the clues,” said Josh. “I’ll go first. The CSA money was in the icebox. Your comment concerning the storage of important paper documents was the clue.”

Next, April said, “The jeweled pistol was in the hollowed out book. Hollowed out books were used to hide dangerous things from children – and the pistol was the only one of the five valuables that could be harmful to a child.”

Justin then said, “The diamond necklace was in the storage box. It was the only one of the five items that belonged to Jean. You gave it away when you mentioned that locks of hair were kept with jewelry.

Mr. Patrick was surprised when Caitlyn Thomas, one of his students from last term but who never said much, offered the fourth clue. “The gold money clip was found in the inlaid box with all of John’s other stuff. That means that only the lithograph photo could have been in the strongbox.”

Justin asked, “Why go to all that trouble to bury a picture?

Mr. Patrick replied, “People of the pre World War II depression era lived in a far different time than we do. They had a totally different view of the world and what was valuable and that was especially true of the older generation. But, for all we know, all of the valuables could have originally been buried and everything except the picture later removed. But, whatever the reason, I am certain that the dark lithograph photo of his parents was far more valuable to John than anything else he owned.”",,akoksal/LongForm
"""What is the 2018 World Happiness Report and how does it rank countries?"" Respond in 25 sentences.",,"Canada is the seventh happiest country in the world, according to the 2018 World Happiness Report.
And once again, Nordic countries have swapped positions -- this year, it’s Finland’s turn on top.
The country jumped from the fifth spot to take over first place from runner-up Norway, followed by Denmark, Iceland and Switzerland rounding out the top five, according to the new report, which tracks happiness from 2015 to 2017 and was co-edited by Canadian economist John F. Helliwell.
Some observers have noted that colder-climate countries tend to be well-represented at the top of the list. Helliwell said that may not be a coincidence.
“An occasionally harsh climate is a good way of building the kind of co-operative spirit . . . and in fact makes people happy to co-operate with each other in protecting and making life work,” he told CTV News Channel on Wednesday.
Helliwell said, in Canada, that sense of community is more pronounced away from the country’s large urban centres.
The top 10 countries are the same as the last two years with some exchanging of spots. Helliwell said Canada has ranked between fourth and seventh since the annual report was first published six years ago.
The United States dropped to 18 after falling from 13 to 14 last year. Helliwell pointed to a worsening health crisis and “declining social capital” relative to other countries on the list.
The biggest gainer was Togo in West Africa, which was the least happy country in 2015 but now lands 17 places higher. Burundi in East Africa ranked last out of all 156 on the list.
The rankings are based on gross domestic product per person, healthy life expectancy and respondents’ own perception of their happiness based on global survey results in which people ranked from 1-10 their level of social support in times of need, their freedom of choice, how corrupt their society is and how generous they are. Because each of the top countries have such high values for each of those variables, it is expected that their positions will swap year to year.
This year’s report is the first to also evaluate the countries where immigrants are happiest. Canada fared even better by that measurement, coming in fourth for most-accepting countries for migrants.
“Although immigrants come from countries with very different levels of happiness, their reported life evaluations converge towards those of other residents in their new countries,” said Helliwell in a press release.
Just like the happiness of those born locally, immigrant happiness is about more than money and instead depends on “a range of features of the social fabric, extending far beyond the higher incomes traditionally thought to inspire and reward migration,” the report reads. Income is of course taken into account, but the report found that there is no gain in happiness from moving to a higher income country.
“The countries with the happiest immigrants are not the richest countries, but instead the countries with a more balanced set of social and institutional supports for better lives,” the report continues.
Immigrants are about as happy as people born in their new country, with the difference being under 0.1 point out of 10, the report says. An immigrant’s happiness depends not just on the happiness of locals but also on the happiness of where they emigrated from, and how accepting locals are of immigrants.

"Redundancy like ""For questions about"" in tag wikis

Tag wikis are polluted with redundant words:

""Questions related to""
""Question regarding""
""Refers to the question concerning about"" (!)
""For questions about""
""Refers to the question regarding""
""Questions involving""
etc.

Besides lack of consistency (even in ""question"" vs ""questions""), I think these words are completely redundant and waste valuable space. Since only questions are tagged, I don't see how it adds any value.
When we look at StackOverflow's tags, they don't usually refer to questions in the first sentence. Questions are sometimes mentioned in the following sentences telling when to and when not to use the tag. I think the first sentence should describe the subject, not be an instruction.
Should tag wikis be fixed?",,"Tag wikis that only read ""Questions about {tag-name}"" are redundant and shouldn't even be accepted.
In one rare case I phrased it exactly in the way above, but in this case it was to remove plagiarism from the tag (and I had no better alternative at that moment).
I have made some other tag wikis containing a phrase like this, but further added explicitly what the word actually stands for. In this case I think the phrase can be removed.

 Bishop Peter Libasci said even after Foley was captured for the first time in Libya in 2011, he ""went back again that we might open our eyes."" 
  
 The Mass was attended by Foley's parents, John and Diane Foley, and hundreds of others in their hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire. Afterward, Libasci read aloud a letter from the Vatican extending the condolences of Pope Francis. 
  
 ""Thank you for loving Jim,"" Diane Foley told the crowd after the Mass. 
  
 The crowd filled every pew and people stood three deep at the back of the church and along both sides of it. Gov. Maggie Hassan, along with U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte, attended the Mass. 
  
 Foley was kidnapped on Thanksgiving Day 2012 while covering the Syrian uprising. The Islamic State group posted a Web video Tuesday showing his killing and said it was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq. 
  
 Libasci invoked the prayer of St. Francis, which begins, ""Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,"" to implore the gathered not to hate but to heal. 
  
 ""It is in giving that we receive,"" he recited. ""It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. It is in dying that we are born to eternal life. To these words, I think we can say, 'Yes, I wish we could do that.' It is not beyond our capability. It is not impossible. Our Lord lived it. Our most Blessed Mother lived it. Many saints have lived it. James lived it."" 
  
 In a packed Our Lady of the Holy Rosary church, the bishop frequently addressed Foley's parents and stressed their son's connection to family. He also prayed for another captive journalist, Steven Sotloff, and all captives. 
  
 ""Jim went back again that we might open our eyes,"" Libasci said. ""That we might indeed know how precious is this gift. May almighty God grant peace to James and to all our fragile world."" 
  
 Libasci said after the Mass that people shouldn't think of vengeance. 
  
 ""Look at what it's done already,"" he said. ""Look at the heartbreak."" 
  
 A funeral for Foley will be Oct. 18, what would have been his 41st birthday. 
  
 Foley's parents on Sunday released a letter that they say their son wrote while in captivity, which he asked an unidentified fellow hostage who was about to be freed to memorize and recount to his family so the letter would not be confiscated by his captors. 
  
 In the letter, posted on a Facebook page called ""Find James Foley,"" Foley described being held with 17 other hostages and passing time by discussing movies, sports and trivia and playing games made up of scraps found in their jail cell. He said the hostages were fed daily and given tea and occasionally coffee. 
  
 Also Sunday, the U.S. government said Peter Theo Curtis of Massachusetts, a journalist who was held hostage for about two years by an al-Qaida-linked group in Syria, was released. White House national security adviser Susan Rice said Curtis, who wrote under the byline Theo Padnos, is now safe outside of Syria. 
  
 At a vigil Saturday night in Rochester, about 200 people gathered to show support for the Foley family. 
  
 ""We are honored that you care and love Jim. We are honored that you recognized the sacrifices he made,"" John Foley said then. ""He loved the Syrian people. He was devoted to telling their story and doing whatever he could to help their fight."" 
  
 Speakers praised Foley's determination to report on the Syrian people uprooted by conflict. 
  
 ""Tonight we want to honor freedom and love: the freedom that James so vehemently believed that all people deserved,"" said Nadia Alawa, founder of NuDay Syria, a Massachusetts-based organization working to ease the pain and loss in Syria. 
  
 The world's largest bloc of Islamic nations denounced Foley's ""heinous"" killing and reiterated its support for international efforts to confront the Islamic State fighters. 
  
 Iyad Madani, chief of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, said in a statement Saturday that the actions of the Islamic State group have nothing to do with the values of Islam or his organization's founding principles of tolerance and co-existence. ||||| John and Diane Foley greet people following a mass in remembrance of their son James Foley.

 ROCHESTER, N.H.—For nearly two years, this community in New Hampshire's seacoast region held on to hope. They tied yellow ribbons around trees and gathered for prayer vigils. 
  
 On Sunday, however, hundreds of people descended on Our Lady of the Holy Rosary parish with a new, painful focus: to remember James Foley, the U.S. journalist and New Hampshire native who was killed last week by extremists in the Middle East after being held captive for nearly two years. 
  
 More than 900 people packed the aisles and pews and gave Mr. Foley's parents, John and Diane—who worship at the church—a standing ovation after the couple expressed their gratitude for the support. A telegram they received last week from the pope was read. 
  
 Tears were shed by many people who said they never met Mr. Foley or his family but who were inspired by him and said he showed courage in venturing into war-torn regions to tell the stories of the oppressed. Claire Carll, a retired real-estate broker from Palm Springs, Calif., who happened to be in New Hampshire, held a small American flag as she approached the church. Sandra Harrington was moved to tears as she sat by a circle of petunias and prayed the Rosary outside before Mass. 
  
 ""In my eyes, he was a disciple of Christ,"" said Ms. Harrington, who is 68, and had driven about an hour from the Manchester area. ""He brought out light into the world and he brought out truth, as Jesus did."" 
  
 President Barack Obama on Wednesday confirmed the death of Mr. Foley, a 40-year-old journalist from New Hampshire and the eldest of five siblings. He disappeared in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012, while heading to the Turkish border on his latest report from the rebel-controlled territories.

 His death, depicted Tuesday in a grisly decapitation video released by Islamic State militants, followed an August 12 email published by GlobalPost, an online news site where Mr. Foley worked as a freelancer. The email from Islamic State said the group would kill Mr. Foley as retribution for U.S. airstrikes against militants in Iraq. 
  
 Mr. Foley's death wasn't in vain, in part because ""the horrific way Jim was butchered"" has sparked a new national conversation about the threat the Islamic State poses not only to Iraq and Syria but also to the U.S., Philip Balboni, chief executive of GlobalPost, told reporters outside the church on Sunday. 
  
 The killing has also raised questions about the U.S. prohibition against negotiating with terrorists. In an email to the Foley family in November 2013, the captors demanded $123 million. Instead, until last week, the family and GlobalPost were trying to raise $5 million, hoping that amount could secure Mr. Foley's release. 
  
 Mr. Foley's younger brother expressed his frustration on television Friday that the U.S. didn't do more to secure his brother's release. 
  
 Charles M. Sennott, co-founder of GlobalPost and executive director of The GroundTruth Project, an affiliated nonprofit organization that trains international correspondents, said after the Mass for Mr. Foley that the issue of ransom needs to be brought into the open and discussed. 
  
 The current ""fragmented"" system, in which some European countries appear to quietly pay, Mr. Sennott said, while the U.S. doesn't, isn't working. 
  
 ""It needs to be pulled out of the darkness and into the light, and addressed as a moral question,"" he said. 
  
 Mr. Sennott said Mr. Foley—who spent 44 days in captivity in Libya in 2011 after being kidnapped while reporting there—was very experienced, but also had an unbridled passion for his work. Mr. Foley wasn't reckless, but he was always going to ""push it to the limit"" and get as close to the front line as he could, Mr. Sennott said. ""That was hard to deal with as an editor but all that effort was for the right reason,"" he said. 
  
 In a brief interview with The Wall Street Journal after Sunday's service, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, said whenever possible, the U.S. should use its military intelligence to try to rescue kidnapped Americans, but that she agreed with President Obama that the U.S. shouldn't pay ransom to terrorist organizations, saying the money is ""just used to harm more people."" Instead, she said the strategy should be one of not only containing the Islamic State but defeating it. ""This is an evil, brutal, but quite sophisticated terror group,"" she said. 
  
 The weekend in Rochester, however, was largely free of political debate. At a Saturday night candlelight vigil that drew about 200 people to Rochester Commons, Mr. Foley's father said ""we are honored that you care and that you love Jim and that you recognize the sacrifice he made,"" according to televised coverage. 
  
 At Sunday's service, called a ""Mass of Healing, Hope and Peace,"" photos of James Foley dotted the church and a handwritten sign, ""Pray for James Foley & His Family"" was propped in the garden outside. The Foley family filled four pews. Afterwards, John and Diane Foley clasped hands with and hugged many parishioners, and then joined their supporters, including Sen. Ayotte and New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, in the church hall. 
  
 The Foley family has established a scholarship in James Foley's name, saying they want to bring his ""empathy, humanity and courage"" to the fields of education and journalism. 
  
 Sunday's service wasn't a funeral Mass. That is planned for Oct. 18, which would have been Mr. Foley's 41st birthday. But it was a day to remember the life of Mr. Foley, whom the Rev. Paul Gousse, the church's pastor, said ""freely laid his [life] down for freedom.""

Describe how the development industry is changing in Toronto.,,"Conventional wisdom has it that Toronto is all full up, that there’s no room left in this ark. Not quite. In fact, there are probably more large-scale mixed-use projects underway in the city than at any time in its recent history.
They’re happening at unwanted malls and in parking lots, at decommissioned school properties and industrial sites. And let’s not forget the massive Downsview Park and, of course, the waterfront. Together, they add up to enough space to change the face of Toronto yet again.
The opportunity is extraordinary, but so are the possibilities of failure. If there’s a reason for optimism, it lies in the fact that local developers have matured in recent decades. Most now realize they must do more to avoid the mistakes that left many of these sites up for grabs. Even in the suburban paradise that is Canada, economic reality has dealt with the sort of default thinking that led to an excess of malls and enough parking spots for every driver looking for Boxing Day bargains.
Today’s mantra is mixed-use and, as mantras go, it’s not bad. It means that the failed planning policies that prevailed from the postwar period until recently has been banished from the city. Developers, if not planners, now include residential, commercial, retail and institutional uses in their projects, as well as community amenities and a serious public realm.
Matt Young, vice-president of development at Capital Developments, talks of trying achieve that urban experience of “organized chaos” at the 7.3-acre property his firm is remaking at Bloor St. W. and Dufferin St. This is a far cry from the regulated sterility of every purpose in its place.
The size of the apartments signals that the focus is more on creating community than constructing a tower or two. For developers, that means the space between buildings is now as important as the buildings themselves. Given what we know about how neighbourhoods work, it’s clear architecture has little to do with success — or failure. This isn’t to say design doesn’t matter; it does. Cabbagetown is a good example; built for middle-class buyers in the late 19th century, it had become slummy in the postwar period. Since then, it’s become one of Toronto’s most desirable (and expensive) neighbourhoods.
Today developers are laying out streets, building parks and planning transportation, shopping and sustainability. In other words, they have become city builders. Like it or not, megaprojects like these are redefining Toronto and how we inhabit it. To avoid the mistakes of the past — St. James Town, Regent Park, Lawrence Heights — developers are learning to think more holistically. Which means, of course, mixed use.
It helps that Waterfront Toronto prepared a series of precinct plans before the developers moved in, but its range is limited. The industry and market are more sophisticated, but it’s still early days. Projects such as these and others, the Honest Ed’s site, Alexandra Park and Regent Park are definitely reasons for hope, which even here, springs eternal.",,akoksal/LongForm

Guillermo del Toro's UFO experience Respond in 806 words.,,"In the interview del Toro briefly explains to Cameron how he was 15 or 16 years old when he was in the company of a friend all alone on a deserted highway, carrying a six-pack of beers –“which we didn’t consume!” he quickly points out– and looking at the stars. Then the two teens noticed a small, bright light moving across the night sky in a non-linear fashion, zipping away from one spot to the other very rapidly.
Guillermo and his friend decided to honk the car horn to see if the zig-zagging object would react. And react it did! The faraway UFO breached the distance between its location and theirs in a matter of seconds, and that’s when they observed it looked like a structured craft witht he stereotypical shape of a flying saucer.
That an incredibly talented artist like Guillermo has had paranormal experiences doesn’t surprise me in the slightest. In my personal essay for UFOs: Reframing the Debate I tried to make the argument that artists and creative individuals seem to be more open to the kind of things most of society tend to frown upon –much more with del Toro, whose life-long love for monsters marked him as an outcast from the beginning– and also perhaps better equipped to engage with these mysteries than if you try to understand them from a strictly ‘left-brain’ approach.
But what fascinates me the most about this is the way del Toro interprets the experience, after so many years: he was disappointed at how ‘badly designed’ and clichéd the saucer looked like –complete with blinking lights that went all around its rim!– His aesthetic criticism didn’t prevent him from experiencing the ‘artificial fear’ often reported by close encounter witnesses though, and in a state of utter panic he and his companion decided the time wasn’t right to play “Human Eye for the Alien Guy” and fled the scene at full speed. The kitschy Disco-like disk kept pace of their vehicle, until eventually they lost sight of it.
The first time I read about Guillermo’s account, it immediately reminded me of another out-of-the-box inconoclast who also had an unusual UFO encounter, although under rather different circumstances: Terence McKenna observed what he described as a typical ‘Adamskian’ flying saucer during his famous ‘La Chorrera Experiment’, amid the deep jungles of Colombia in 1971.
So here we have two non-ordinary experiences in which there is something of a self-negating component added to the mix –as it’s usually the case with high strangeness events– sprinkled with a bit of tricksterish humor over the top. McKenna was first and foremost and intellectual, so perhaps in his case the purpose behind it was to take a slight jab at his ego and reminding him not to take himself too seriously.
An hallucination caused by overactive imagination? A liminal vision induced by an endocrine secretion of DMT? All of the above? Who can say, and if there’s a link between these early experiences and the UFO close encounter one needs to take into account the second witness to the event, whose name and opinion on the matter are unknown. Did he also observe the same ‘badly designed’ flying saucer just as del Toro? or did his sighting differ from what the Mexican filmmaker recollects, almost 40 years after it happened? We do not know the answer to this, and yet it wouldn’t be the first time witnesses report different things about the same event –which further makes the case for a ‘co-creation’ component in paranormal phenomena, just as suggested by UFO author Greg Bishop. The Co-creation Hypothesis, for those who haven’t heard of it, is the idea that the witness is not a mere passive espectator to a UFO/paranormal event, and that somehow the outcome of it maybe influenced by the individual’s cultural framework and expectations –whether this is a matter on how the mind is desperately seeking to filter and parse an extraordinary experience, in order to interpret it as best it can according to a given worldview, or the phenomenon is actively ‘morphing itself’ so it can fit with our cultural preconceptions is a bigger yarn to untangle. Terence McKenna, after all, once said the UFO phenomenon was nothing but the Mushroom intelligence disguising itself as an alien invasion so it wouldn’t alarm us monkeys too much (!).
In any case, there’s no denying Guillermo’s masterpieces are now lauded all over the world, and have greatly helped us to ’embrace the otherness’, be that in the form of otherworldly creatures, demons with a heart of gold, people with different sexual orientation, or foreign aliens trying to make a life on a faraway land.
His dream worlds have inspired us, shown ourselves from a different angle, and laid bridges connecting us closer together.

"""Are Saudi Arabia and other regional powers responsible for the chemical weapons attack in Damascus, and not the Syrian government as western powers claim?"" Respond in 477 words.",,"Syrian rebels in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta have admitted to Associated Press correspondent Dale Gavlak that they were responsible for last week’s chemical weapons incident which western powers have blamed on Bashar Al-Assad’s forces, revealing that the casualties were the result of an accident caused by rebels mishandling chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia.
“From numerous interviews with doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families….many believe that certain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the (deadly) gas attack,” writes Gavlak. (back up version here).
According to Abdel-Moneim, the weapons exploded inside a tunnel, killing 12 rebels.
“More than a dozen rebels interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government,” writes Gavlak.
If accurate, this story could completely derail the United States’ rush to attack Syria which has been founded on the “undeniable” justification that Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack. Dale Gavlak’s credibility is very impressive. He has been a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press for two decades and has also worked for National Public Radio (NPR) and written articles for BBC News.
The website on which the story originally appeared – Mint Press (which is currently down as a result of huge traffic it is attracting to the article) is a legitimate media organization based in Minnesota. The Minnesota Post did a profile on them last year.
Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in providing rebels, whom they have vehemently backed at every turn, with chemical weapons, is no surprise given the revelations earlier this week that the Saudis threatened Russia with terror attacks at next year’s Winter Olympics in Sochi unless they abandoned support for the Syrian President.
“I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,” Prince Bandar allegedly told Vladimir Putin, the Telegraph reports.
The Obama administration is set to present its intelligence findings today in an effort prove that Assad’s forces were behind last week’s attack, despite American officials admitting to the New York Times that there is no “smoking gun” that directly links President Assad to the attack.
As we reported earlier this week, intercepted intelligence revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry was making “panicked” phone calls to Syria’s chemical weapons department demanding answers in the hours after the attack, suggesting that it was not ordered by Assad’s forces.
UPDATE: Associated Press contacted us to confirm that Dale Gavlak is an AP correspondent, but that her story was not published under the banner of the Associated Press. We didn’t claim this was the case, we merely pointed to Gavlak’s credentials to stress that she is a credible source, being not only an AP correspondent, but also having written for PBS, BBC and Salon.com.",,akoksal/LongForm

"""Background Paragraph: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.""

"""What are the new features of Symfony 4?""",,"Symfony 4 launches on November 30th 2017, some two years after the previous major release that was Symfony 3. Symfony 3 can be thought of as a stabilisation release with code cleanup, some new functionality and housekeeping Standard Edition (AKA Full Stack Framework).
In the latest incarnation there are more significant changes, especially to the framework and some key components. Let's take a look at four features that address frustrations that I've had in the past.
The Symfony Standard Edition is a feature rich framework that is used for many capable Business Application Platforms like Akeneo PIM, eZ Platform CMS, ORO CRM, Sylius eCommerce and a host of others - proprietary and Open Source.
The trouble is that, with the framework comes some rigidity and boilerplate. This is why many (me included) rather looked at using micro frameworks for simple tasks early on. I was pretty happy with using Silex, or something completely different, when I knew wouldn't need much server side logic.
With Symfony Flex replacing the Standard Edition from Symfony 4 onwards, there seems to be a decent middle path. The new directory structure is easier to approach, while you still get the convenience of YAML based configurations and the power of full DI Container. There's less confusion on where to place your templates, no need to explain why you need the AppBundle.
Since 2011 the defacto method for extending Symfony Framework apps has been the Bundle System. Over the years it has proven to be a very powerful method that has enabled to extend and modify how the underlying framework functions.
The technical solution of Bundles may have proven to be a good one, but for developer experience they leave room to improve on in Symfony Standard Edition. Each time you want to install a new bundle, you'll need to go through manuals steps of installing the dependency, registering the bundle and configuring.
While the routine of enabling bundles may not be much of a chore when you're used to working with the framework, it certainly can be intimidating for the beginner. Installing bundles, registering kernels, defining parameters and configurations is a mouthful for someone coming from, say WordPress or another CMS with a rich plugin/module/extension ecosystem.
With Symfony Flex, you now gain easier access to installing and managing framework extensions with a a mechanism known as Recipes. A recipe is only a JSON file that defines what steps should be taken when a new bundle is installed. This means the often repeated steps are done automatically and a standard config is put in place.
The Symfony Dependency Injection Component is a popular part of many applications, with and without the Symfony Framework. Over 2100 projects report is as a dependency, including projects like phpBB and Drupal. In Symfony 4 this component has received a lot of improvements.
The DI mechanism allows organising code within your application to reusable services that can be (re)used where appropriate, and even swapped out for others as needed. This flexibility has come at a price, as some boilerplate configuration that has been needed to be written and maintained.
Again this configuration is may not feel like a big overhead if you're used to working with the framework day-to-day, but there it does seem superfluous if you're used to the terse syntax of a micro framework like Sinatra or Express. Anyone whose worked with Symfony SE has had their fair share of YAML fatigue.
In Symfony 4 the Dependency Injection Component now registers every class as a service automatically. This means that instead of needing to register services, they're automatically picked up with the class as the identifier (e.g. App\Greeting\HelloService vs. manually configured app.greeting.hello_service). You can also inject them directly in the method signature via PHP type hinting.
In 2015 Symfony added the Asset Component which allowed referencing static files with versioning, setting up a CDN and more. This all enabled a sane front end asset management workflow with symlinks from bundle's directories to the web root. This all worked, but there was still some confusion and no recommendation from the framework on how to process and organise assets.
With the launch of Symfony 4.0 and Flex the project addresses a number of areas that have been painpoints to many developers. Cutting overhead and reducing boilerplate are a welcome improvements for small one-off apps churned out in a few days.
With Flex the framework now has a mechanism that is capable of configuring framework extensions, making it more competitive with higher level products like Content Management Systems that have their own module/extension repositories. The API-Platform is an excellent example of what can be built on top of the Flex ecosystem.
In addition to the features and improvements mentioned in this article there have been a number of new components and capabilities introduced already in the 3.x range releases leading up to 4.0. Symfony 3.4 is released at the same time as 4.0 and is at feature parity with it. Even if you're not starting a new 4.0 Flex project, you can start using the improvements with reasonable effort.
For example, It is completely feasible to take a 2013 Symfony2 SE project and port it over to 3.4 with reasonable effort. Armed with the DI ergonomy improvements and more, you can then gradually move this from Standard Edition to Flex if you see this as an advantage. Flex starts light, but scales to projects of high complexity.
So maybe the ultimate killer feature of Symfony 4 in the end is capacity to keep improving your existing codebase, but improving and modernising it gradually.",,akoksal/LongForm
I'm interested in learning how to be naturally beautiful as a teen girl. Could you break it down into 15 easy-to-follow steps?,,"1. Keeping your skin clean gives you a healthy, fresh-faced look.: Put your best face forward every day! Massage a gentle cleanser that works with your skin type on your face in the morning. This removes oil and dead skin. Then, rinse your face with cool water and pat it dry.

Choose non-comedogenic products that won't clog your pores and cause acne.

Look for skincare products designed to meet your skincare needs. Your skin type might be sensitive, dry, oily, or normal, for instance.
2. Moisturizer plumps and hydrates your skin.: If your skin dries out, it can look red or flaky. Apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to your skin right after you wash it to lock in moisture.

Go for a fragrance-free moisturizer if you've got sensitive skin.

For an extra-moisturizing product, choose a moisturizing cream instead of a lotion.
3. Protect your skin from sun damage with SPF 15.: Your teenage years are the time to start lifelong beauty habits and these start with your skin! Apply non-comedogenic sunscreen after moisturizer and before makeup to prevent dryness, freckles, and other sun-related damage.
Sometimes, hormones that change when you're a teenager can make your skin look patchy or pigmented. Sunscreen can help prevent this pigmentation.
4. Products with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can clear up blemishes.: Skin problems are an unfortunate part of being a teenager. As your hormones change, your skin produces more oil, which can then get trapped in your pores leading to pimples. To get clear, healthy-looking skin, apply an acne spot treatment once a day and use cleansers that are formulated to kill bacteria that cause acne.
If you're really struggling with acne, talk with a dermatologist. Sometimes, you may need a stronger skincare product or they might recommend medication to control the cause of your acne.
5. Green color corrector and a touch of concealer can disguise pimples.: When you're a teen, pimples are pretty much inevitable. Fortunately, with a few makeup products, you can easily hide them. A dab of green color corrector can cover up red, irritated skin and blemishes. You can also use a reddish-orange color corrector to cover older, brown acne scars. Then, rub a tinted complexion corrector or beauty balm over your entire face to give it a glowy, healthy look.

Skip heavy products like liquid foundation. These can crease and cake throughout the day.
Sleeping in your makeup is a big no-no! Make a habit of washing the makeup off of your face before you go to bed to prevent future breakouts.
6. A little mascara and blush can emphasize your favorite features.: Don't feel like you have to wear makeup every day to change the way you look. Use makeup to play up the features you like! A few swipes of mascara or curling your eyelashes can bring out the beauty of your eyes, for instance. A little cream or powder blush can add a touch of color to your cheeks for a healthy glow.
The point of makeup is to emphasize your favorite features so you feel great about yourself. You don't need to cover your entire face with tons of makeup to look beautiful!
7. You don't need a lot of makeup when a smile can light up your face.: Studies actually show that smiling women are seen as more attractive. Smiling is also a great way to nurture a positive attitude. It's hard to be upset with a smile on your face.
Are you self-conscious about your smile? Practice smiling and remind yourself that you have a beautiful smile.
8. Give your smile a makeover with whitening strips.: If you feel self-conscious about your teeth, you may not be giving your biggest, best smiles. To feel more confident, use home whitening strips that you apply to your teeth once a day. After a week or two, you should notice a brighter smile, so show it off!
To keep your teeth looking their whitest, buy a whitening toothpaste to use, too.
9. Show off healthy nails with a pop of nail polish color.: Nails are a great way to express yourself—you can experiment with fun colors or match your nails to special outfits. Start with healthy nails that you've trimmed and buffed. Then, apply fun nail color. There are lots of nail polishes with unique textures so play around to find what you like.
If you're not a fan of nail polish, it's totally fine! Skip the colors and keep your nails in top form by shaping and buffing them regularly.
10. Brighten your entire look by washing your hair before it gets greasy.: While it might be tempting to pull your hair back into a ponytail when it needs a wash, just take a few minutes and shampoo it. Then, blow dry it or let it air dry if you're a wash-and-go kind of girl. You'll feel more confident with a great hair day and it will show!
To protect your hair from damage, brush it gently to detangle it. Try to avoid heat damage—don't use the blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron every day.
11. Enjoy nutritious food instead of trying extreme calorie-cutting diets.: Eat a diet that's got fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and good sources of protein. If you notice that fatty foods or sugar make your skin look dull or oily, cut them out of your diet. Your skin will thank you!
If you feel like it's hard to eat healthily, block out an hour each week where you prep healthy snacks or lunches to take to school. This way, you won't be tempted to grab junk food or unhealthy options from the vending machine.
12. Drink at least 8 glasses of water.: This can help clear up acne and make your skin look radiant. Skip carbonated energy drinks or sodas that are full of caffeine and sugar.
Tired of drinking plain water? Reach for a can of unsweetened seltzer water. These come in a ton of tasty flavors.
13. Remember that beauty doesn't come in a single shape or size.: If you spend lots of time on the scale or in front of the mirror, you may make yourself miserable. Instead of obsessing over your physical appearance, look at yourself and think about what you like about your body.
For example, if you've got curves, embrace them! Don't try to hide or change the unique body that you have or you'll just make yourself miserable.
14. Project self-confidence as you stand tall.: If you're hunched over with your head bent low, people won't be able to see you well. To let your natural beauty show, sit up straight with your head held high. When you walk, keep your shoulders back and stand tall. Be proud of the beautiful person you are!
If you've got bad posture habits, it can take a while to break them, but keep trying. It should get easier over time.
15. You'll look beautiful doing things that you're passionate about.: Think about the things you love to do—it might be going for a run, listening to music with friends, or playing a sport. You're probably excited and enjoying yourself and it will show. Since natural beauty comes from within, do things that make you feel happy and joyful on the inside.
Don't be afraid to express yourself. If you love to sing, for instance, let your voice be heard.

Could you outline 14 practical steps to achieve treat ocular rosacea?,,"1. If you believe you are experiencing ocular rosacea, it is best to consult your doctor. Your eye doctor or general practitioner is the best person to diagnose and treat ocular rosacea. Severe or untreated problems can lead to scarring on the eyelid or corneal abrasions, both of which can impact your vision. That is why it is best to talk to a doctor when you first notice early symptoms. Common symptoms include:

Dry eyes
Eye itchiness
Feeling something gritty in your eyes
Burning in the eyes
Sensitivity to light
Blurred vision
Eye redness
Swollen eyelids
Watery eyes
2. Most of the time your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to help clear up and treat ocular rosacea. You may be asked to take oral antibiotics for up to 1 month. Common medications include tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, minocycline.
Your doctor may choose a particular drug based on your medical history and specific symptoms.
3. Dip a cotton swab in warm water and move it across your eyelid. Use it to remove any debris and/or oil from your eyelid. Repeat on the other eye, and complete this practice twice a day.
Your doctor may advise you to use very diluted baby shampoo to cleanse your eyelids instead of plain water.
4. Soak a clean washcloth in hot water. Wring out the washcloth, lie back, and place the washcloth over your closed eyes. Leave it there for 5-10 minutes. This should both loosen your blocked glands and help to soften any remaining debris.
You may want to clean your eyelids again if the warm compress loosens any excess oil or debris.
5. In the midst of a flare up, it is best to avoid make up completely. Also avoid using facial care products that contain fragrances or other skin irritants. In most cases, you can resume using non-comedogenic makeup after your flare up is over.
6. While your eyes are irritated, it is best not to use contact lenses. Wear glasses instead, and give your eyes the opportunity to heal. In most cases, you will be able to resume the use of contact lenses after your flare up has passed.
7. If your ocular rosacea results in dry eyes, you can control this symptom with artificial tears. Look for preservative-free artificial tears. Add these drops to your eyes as needed, up to 5 times per day.
8. Although ocular rosacea can usually be controlled with medication and other remedies, these actions don't actually cure the condition. Ocular rosacea is considered chronic and recurring, although many people experience periods of remission.
9. You can help to prevent flare ups of ocular rosacea by continuing to wash your eyelids 1-2 times per day, even when you are not exhibiting rosacea symptoms. Try making this a regular part of your grooming routine.
10. Ocular rosacea can be brought on by different triggers for different people. For some people, eating hot, spicy foods can signal a flare up. If this is true for you, avoid eating these foods.
11. Another potential rosacea trigger is alcohol. If you find that you are prone to rosacea flare-ups after consuming alcohol, you should probably avoid it. Try limiting yourself to 1-2 drinks per week.
12. When you are not experiencing a flare up, it is probably safe to use makeup and other cosmetics. However, it is important to make sure that the products you use are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic.

Look for labels on cosmetic products that read fragrance-free and non-comedogenic.
Shop at health foods store and specialty cosmetic stores to find special products.
13. Sun exposure is another common rosacea trigger. Use a sunhat, wear sunglasses, and apply sunscreen any time you'll be out in the sun. Limit the amount of time you spend in direct sunlight. Never use tanning beds.
14. Some research indicates that consuming flaxseed oil, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, can help reduce flare-ups of rosacea. Look for flaxseed oil, flaxseed supplement capsules, or whole flaxseed at grocery stores and health food stores.
Try to consume about 2–3 teaspoons (9.9–14.8 ml) of flaxseed oil or 0.125 cups (30 ml) of ground flaxseed each day.

What happened when a GOP state representative was asked to leave the Texas Democratic Party’s state convention while brandishing his gun?,,"A GOP state representative was escorted out of the Texas Democratic Party’s state convention on Friday after apparently brandishing his gun when confronted about an anti-liberal prank he had just pulled.
According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Representative Briscoe Cain and three other men were removed by the Fort Worth Police Department following the incident.
Cain and political consultant Aaron Harris were initially asked to leave after distributing dozens of fake yard signs with satirical messages reading, “This home is a gun-free safe space.” In an image Harris later posted to Twitter, some Texas Democrats can be seen posing and smiling with the signs, apparently unaware of the fun being had.
Video captured the moment when Cain appeared to brandish his handgun. After being asked to leave the exhibit hall, Cain and the other right-wing activists returned to a foyer on the north side of the building, believing it to be a public place.
At that point, a delegate asks Cain, “When’d you go gun-free?” To which Cain physically replies by lifting his shirt and showing what looks like a holstered weapon. That interaction was around 4:30 p.m. and the police quickly took over. Cain and his group left the building at around 5:20 p.m.
Texas Democratic Party Convention Director Adam Goodrum said Cain’s group had caused “a bit of a disturbance” after delegate Mirian Spencer witnessed Cain allegedly drawing attention to his weapon after the prank had run its course.
Cain is currently serving his first term in the Texas House of Representatives and has been ranked by Rice University political science Professor Mark Jones as the most conservative lawmaker in the Texas House.",,akoksal/LongForm
"Prime Divisor Table

Intro
Something I've played around with in recreational mathematics has been construction of a divisor table to visually compare/contrast the prime divisors of a set of numbers. The set of input numbers are across the top as column labels, the prime divisors are on the left as row labels, and a mark indicates where the two line up.
For example, for input 6, 9, 14, 22 a table similar to the following would be constructed:
    6  9 14 22
 2  *     *  *
 3  *  *
 7        *
11           *

This is because 6 has prime divisors of 2 and 3, 9 has prime divisors of 3, and so on.
Construction

The table is constructed such that the input numbers form column labels that are separated by spaces and in ascending order (you can assume they are pre-sorted), and the prime divisors are listed on the left in ascending order one per line forming the row labels.
Note that leading spaces on the prime divisors and input numbers may be required if the numbers are different lengths, so that all columns are the same width and line up appropriately.
Each divisor is represented by a single * (or other suitable ASCII character of your choosing, so long as the same character is used for all occurrences).
Multiple divisors are ignored (e.g., 3 x 3 = 9 but there's only one * for that intersection).
The * can be placed anywhere horizontally in the column, so long as it's unambiguous (I have all my examples with the * right-aligned).

Input

A list of positive integers in any convenient format, each >1.
You can assume that the input is pre-sorted.
The input is guaranteed to have only unique values.

Output
The resulting ASCII art representation of the prime divisor table.
Rules

Leading or trailing newlines or whitespace are all optional, so long as the characters themselves line up correctly.
If it's shorter to have a divider line separating the column/row headings from the tabular data, that's allowed, too.
Either a full program or a function are acceptable. If a function, you can return the output rather than printing it.
If possible, please include a link to an online testing environment so people can try out your code!
Standard loopholes are forbidden.
This is code-golf so all usual golfing rules apply, and the shortest code (in bytes) wins.

Examples
6,9,14,22

    6  9 14 22
 2  *     *  *

You can adjust this setting if needed or make sure that you don't have that many items in the droplist. As Michael mentioned, it will be a bad UX if you have that many items in the droplist... also consider performance - Sitecore did put a max on the result set for a reason ;)

Respond in 736 words. Describe the main points of the day two talks at Ethereal 2018.,,"During the second day of Ethereal, speakers sought to answer: What does the future hold for blockchain technology and mass adoption?
Crypto prices may have crashed since the December peak, but the crowd at Ethereal is largely focused on the power of the technology, and most are still looking forward. Saturday's speakers gave their piece on a critical question: Where do we go from here?
""Once [a blockchain developer's] project is live, they have no power, no influence, on whether it succeeds,"" said Vlad Zamfir, an Ethereum blockchain researcher. He emphasized that blockchain development is shaped by social consensus, and getting people to side with a specific fork is a responsibility held by the crypto-focused media.
Ronny Chieng, a comedian from ""The Daily Show,"" received a roar of laughter from the crowd as he joked about his lack of knowledge on blockchain, but he still managed to get his point across: To reach people with no interest in tech, enthusiasts must speak their language. When those in the community reach out to mainstream media and effectively communicate with them, they will use their influence to spread the word, and reach the lay audience.
Vanessa Grellet, executive director of social impact at Consensys, spoke on reaching individuals in a different way: identifying critical problems facing humanity and building solutions tailored to their needs.
Governments need to understand this new wave of technology. Brian Forde, former tech advisor to President Obama, pointed out US representatives' poor understanding of tech, as evidenced by the Mark Zuckerberg fiasco. He also wants to see blockchain implemented as an accountability tool: Constituents can voice their opinions on a public blockchain to influence their representative's vote, unlike the current system of private tallies made by secretaries for each constituent phone call.
Yorke Rhodes, founder of Blockchain at Microsoft, shared his vision for tokenizing our lives. Your car can charge on electric plates at stoplights, with the plate identifying and billing you based on your vehicle's cryptographic ID. Your personal assistant can understand details of your morning commute and alter your alarm wake-up time if any obstacles arise to delay you.
The overall consensus among the day's speakers seemed to be: To reach global adoption, the community must identify and strategically overcome roadblocks, then target the individual.
Joseph Lubin, founder of Consensys, gave the closing remarks at Ethereal 2018, and shared his vision for our decentralized future.
""Few people feel they are real stakeholders in this human enterprise,"" Lubin began. He explained that in this top-down economy, we're held up by large corporations, but challenged their ability to maintain efficiency the larger they grew. In Lubin's vision, the individual, or the small corporation, will hold up our global economy, and we will all hold a stake in each others' endeavors. With shared ownership, he believes everyone will feel a shared responsibility for others' success.
Lubin argued that existing players in the sharing economy aren't truly embracing peer-to-peer exchange. He named AirBnB and Uber as little more than content aggregators and service providers, who rip off the individual with exorbitant fees.
He asserted that Ethereum is the true decentralized web, and that it is creating the real sharing economy. While Netflix is a two-sided market (service provider to consumer) and Facebook is a three-sided market (Facebook is the intermediary, advertisers are customers, and users are the product), the decentralized web is an N-sided market (multiple players interact to reach a shared goal).
With the decentralized web, individuals can hold a secure and portable version of their identity, and selectively share information with a range of services. The key is for those services to interact with each other, each using only the information you agreed to provide.
One of the biggest questions people have is when this revolution will reach the general population. To address this, Lubin explained that we must view it not as a revolution, but as an evolution. It took 10 years for the internet to have ramifications for consumers, and we're still discovering its potential. We're only around five years into pushing blockchain as a tool for a variety of industries and needs, and while it may feel that progress is slow, Lubin believes it will soon grow exponentially, and blockchain will be everywhere; it will be part of our everyday lives.

"Why is Cross Game named so? What is the significance of the title?

I'm curious as to why Cross Game is named so. The ""cross"" appears in the anime in various forms:

When altered to fit Japanese phonotactic constraints, both ""close"" /kloʊs/ and ""cross"" /kɹɔs/ end up as クロス kurosu. So, I guess, for whatever reason, Adachi seems to have chosen to make the English/romanized title ""Cross Game"". ",,akoksal/LongForm
"""SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge 
Complex Expansion and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge 
Expansion Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the western basin of Lake Erie, as part of the Great 
        Lakes ecosystem--
                    (A) is the largest freshwater ecosystem in the 
                world; and
                    (B) is vitally important to the economic and 
                environmental future of the United States;
            (2) over the 30-year period preceding the date of enactment 
        of this Act, the citizens and governmental institutions of the 
        United States and Canada have devoted increasing attention and 
        resources to the restoration of the water quality and fisheries 
        of the Great Lakes, including the western basin;
            (3) that increased awareness has been accompanied by a 
        gradual shift toward a holistic ecosystem approach that 
        highlights a growing recognition that shoreline areas, commonly 
        referred to as nearshore terrestrial ecosystems, are an 
        integral part of the western basin and the Great Lakes 
        ecosystem;
            (4) the Great Lakes account for more than 90 percent of the 
        surface freshwater in the United States;
            (5) the western basin of Lake Erie receives approximately 
        90 percent of its flow from the Detroit River and only 
        approximately 10 percent from tributaries;
            (6) the western basin is an important ecosystem that 
        includes a number of distinct islands, channels, rivers, and 
        shoals that support dense populations of fish, wildlife, and 
        aquatic plants;
            (7) coastal wetland of Lake Erie supports the largest 
        diversity of plant and wildlife species in the Great Lakes;
            (8) because Lake Erie is located at a more southern 
        latitude than other Great Lakes, the moderate climate of Lake 
        Erie is appropriate for many species that are not found in or 
        along the northern Great Lakes;
            (9) more than 300 species of plants, including 37 
        significant species, have been identified in the aquatic and 
        wetland habitats of the western basin;
            (10) the shallow western basin of Lake Erie, extending from 
        the Lower Detroit River to Sandusky Bay, is home to the 
        greatest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie, including--
                    (A) Mouille, Metzger, and Magee marshes;
                    (B) the Maumee Bay wetland complex;
                    (C) the wetland complexes flanking Locust Point; 
                and
                    (D) the wetland in Sandusky Bay;
            (11) the larger islands of the United States in western 
        Lake Erie have wetland in small embayments;
            (12) the wetland in the western basin comprises some of the 
        most important waterfowl habitat in the Great Lakes;
            (13) waterfowl, wading birds, shore birds, gulls and terns, 
        raptors, and perching birds use the wetland in the western 
        basin for migration, nesting, and feeding;
            (14) hundreds of thousands of diving ducks stop to rest in 
        the Lake Erie area during autumn migration from Canada to 
        points east and south;
            (15) the wetland of the western basin provides a major 
        stopover for sea ducks, such as migrating common goldeneye, 
        common mergansers, and ruddy duck;
            (16) the international importance of Lake Erie is indicated 
        in the United States by congressional designation of the Ottawa 
        and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges;
            (17)(A) Lake Erie has an international reputation for 
        walleye, perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, 
        birding, photography, and duck hunting; and
            (B) on an economic basis, tourism in the Lake Erie area 
        accounts for an estimated $1,500,000,000 in retail sales and 
        more than 50,000 jobs;
            (18)(A) many of the 417,000 boats that are registered in 
        the State of Ohio are used in the western basin, in part to 
        fish for the estimated 10,000,000 walleye that migrate from the 
        lake to spawn; and
            (B) that internationally renowned walleye fishery drives 
        much of the $2,000,000,000 sport fishing industry in the State 
        of Ohio;
            (19) coastal wetland in the western basin has been 
        subjected to intense pressure for 150 years;
            (20) prior to 1850, the western basin was part of an 
        extensive coastal marsh and swamp system consisting of 
        approximately 122,000 hectares that comprised a portion of the 
        Great Black Swamp;
            (21) by 1951, only 12,407 wetland hectares remained in the 
        western basin;
            (22) 50 percent of that acreage was destroyed between 1972 
        and 1987, leaving only approximately 5,000 hectares in 
        existence today;
            (23) along the Michigan shoreline, coastal wetland was 
        reduced by 62 percent between 1916 and the early 1970s;
            (24) the development of the city of Monroe, Michigan, has 
        had a particularly significant impact on the coastal wetland at 
        the mouth of the Raisin River;
            (25) only approximately 100 hectares remain physically 
        unaltered today in an area in which, 70 years ago, marshes were 
        10 times more extensive;
            (26) in addition to the actual loss of coastal wetland 
        acreage along the shores of Lake Erie, the quality of much 
        remaining dike wetland has been degraded by numerous stressors, 
        especially excessive loadings of sediments and nutrients, 
        contaminants, shoreline modification, exotic species, and the 
        diking of wetland; and
            (27) protective peninsula beach systems, such as the former 
        Bay Point and Woodtick, at the border of Ohio and Michigan near 
        the mouth of the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay, have been eroded 
        over the years, exacerbating erosion along the shorelines and 
        negatively affecting breeding and spawning grounds.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to establish a national wildlife refuge 
complex in the State of Ohio--
            (1)(A) to protect the remaining high-quality fish and

        are lost to further development; and
            (B) to restore and enhance degraded wildlife habitats 
        associated with the western basin;
            (2) in partnership with nongovernmental and private 
        organizations and private individuals dedicated to habitat 
        enhancement, to conserve, enhance, and restore the native 
        aquatic and terrestrial community characteristics of the 
        western basin (including associated fish, wildlife, and plant 
        species);
            (3) to facilitate partnerships among the United States Fish 
        and Wildlife Service, Canadian national and provincial 
        authorities, State and local governments, local communities in 
        the United States and Canada, conservation organizations, and 
        other non-Federal entities to promote public awareness of the 
        resources of the western basin; and
            (4) to advance the collective goals and priorities that--
                    (A) were established in the report entitled ``Great 
                Lakes Strategy 2002--A Plan for the New Millennium'', 
                developed by the United States Policy Committee,

Concerned about ratings, Greg is encouraged by Judith to hire Robin as IBCs new anchorman. Although he opposes Gregs decision, Danton Miller, the head of programming, is unable to overrule his boss. Soon afterward, feeling threatened by Gregs support of Robins plan to take his newscast to primetime, Dan decides to build a variety show around secondrate comedian Christie Lane to prove that the audience prefers crass entertainment to more cerebral programming. Christie is a hit in the ratings, and Jerry Nelson, a homosexual friend of Robin, arranges for the shows sponsor to hire Amanda, a fashion model and Robins occasional girlfriend, as the onair representative of its product. After her first spot airs, Amanda skips a celebratory party and goes to Robin. Shattered when she finds Robin with a nude woman, she attends the party alone. Christie Lane, smitten with Amanda, proposes marriage when a drunken Amanda agrees to go home with him. Judith persuades Robin to have lunch with her, but they end up in bed instead. During their rendezvous, Greg suffers a severe heart attack. Judith, who holds Gregs power of attorney, appoints Robin to act as head of the network while she takes her husband to Switzerland to recuperate. Soon afterward, having rejected Amanda yet again, Robin is shaken by the news of Amandas suicide. He goes out for a walk. Propositioned by a prostitute, he accompanies her to his room, but then changes his mind, and beats up the hooker. He then confesses to Jerry, who agrees to provide an alibi for Robin. In return, Jerry asks for a slave bracelet engraved with Robins name. Judith returns to New York with Greg, now recovered. When Robin refuses to resume their affair, Judith convinces her husband to reclaim control of the network, thereby demoting Robin. In response, Robin threatens to quit entirely, a move which would result in problems between Greg and the shareholders. When Robin visits Los Angeles, Jerry persuades him to attend a party at the home of the actor Alfie Knight, Jerrys new boyfriend. Robin, in turn, invites Judith who is also in the city. At the party, Robin is pleased to see aspiring actress Maggie Stewart, who rebuffs him. Judith, meanwhile, becomes annoyed when Robin neglects her for Jerry and Alfie. After most of the guests have gone, Judith, still angry, finds Jerrys slave bracelet on the floor. Reading the inscription, she threatens to expose Robin. Jerry and Alfie try to retrieve the bracelet, which leads to a brawl. Soon the police arrive, and Robin explains the fight by claiming that he had instigated it by making a drunken pass at Judith. Later, as Robin leaves the police station, his reputation in ruins, Maggie Stewart pulls up in her car and asks him if he needs a ride. He declines.",,akoksal/LongForm

What are the problems with existing gun laws?,,"The purpose of most gun laws, at least as expressed by those who support them, is to keep guns out of criminal hands and to keep people safe. Few gun control activists will claim they want to disarm law-abiding citizens. Part of that is probably just political expedience–it’s just not kosher to want to disarm everyone, even today–and part is that some really don’t want to disarm the law-abiding.
Yet, despite the laws on the books, criminals keep getting guns. It’s like gun laws don’t actually stop them. Here’s one example of just how they bypass them.
Metro Police officers assigned a Juvenile Crime Task Force Unit to the Knollcrest Apartments on Creekwood Drive when they noticed a group of people standing around a silver Buick on Saturday.
According to a Metro Police affidavit, when police approached the group, the suspect, identified as Deshawn Williams, fled to a nearby apartment.
After obtaining permission to search the apartment, officers found a .357 magnum revolver in a bedroom closet. A check of this weapon revealed it to have been reported stolen out of Hendersonville.
Police then went to the vehicle that Williams was standing by and noticed a black 9mm handgun in plain view, which was reportedly stolen from Davidson County.
Williams denied being in possession of these weapons, but was found to be in constructive possession of them due to close proximity.
In short, it appears this convicted felon was in possession of two stolen guns.
Aren’t gun laws supposed to stop this from happening? Isn’t the purpose of those laws to keep guns out of the wrong hands?
The fact is, gun laws keep guns out of those hands legally. What that means is that a convicted felon can’t walk into a gun store and purchase a firearm legally and then commit crimes again.
So instead, they steal guns from people who aren’t prohibited. They buy guns from others who have stolen the firearms. They obtain them outside of the law in any way they can.
Meanwhile, gun control activists look at the unlawful acts committed with these unlawfully obtained guns and think we need more laws. They don’t get that the laws aren’t working because those who will break the law with a gun will damn sure break the law to obtain a gun.
What Williams is alleged to have done, being in possession of two firearms despite his status as a felon, should tell you all you need to know about the effectiveness of gun control. The fact that he ran from the cops immediately indicates that we’re not talking about a master criminal here, someone too smart to be stopped by mere laws. No, we’re talking about a street-level guy who can’t figure out how to not grab the attention of the police.
If someone like that can get guns, then maybe it’s time to start acknowledging that the gun laws aren’t working and, if you’re serious about curbing violence, try something else?",,akoksal/LongForm

I saw your advertisement in the USA and I'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising.

I'm eighteen years old and I'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment, that's why I need to work in order to pay my fee. 
I have some experience working with children from all ages, besides I don't mind hard work and I learn quickly.
Also I've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country.
I consider myself really active, sociable, well-organized and above all patient, therefore I think I'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment, especially working overseas plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

"What's the plan against Black's kingside fianchetto when playing Queen's pawn game?

I often play 1. d4. In many of the variations that arise, Black decides to castle kingside with the bishop fianchetto. 
I do not know what the general plan is in this case. Normally without the fianchetto I would play f4-f5, some kind of Marshall plan or Stonewall formation with the Knight. But when there is a fianchetto I do not know what to play for.
I know the question is vague. But I am looking for strategies from different players with different styles. What to do with a kingside fianchetto when playing 1.d4 and also castling kingside?",,"You can still play a Stonewall Attack when Black decides to castle kingside with the bishop fianchetto.

The stonewall attack is a solid opening with grip in the center: 

White controls the important central squares (d4, and e5) 
White can install a knight in e5 which will force Black to weaken its position if it wants to remove it.
White can play this typical manoeuvre to exchange the bad bishop in
c1 against the knight in f6 by playing Bc1-d2-e1-h4.
With a closed center, White can then expand on the king's side with g4...

Black reacts with d6
The setup with d6 suggested by @user1583209 is very clever. d6 is a flexible move that allows Black to counter-attack with e5. Here is an example where Black is okay:

Describe Robert Mueller's recent court filing regarding the upcoming trial of Paul Manafort.,,"Robert Mueller's office has called out allegedly inaccurate reporting on the Russia investigation in a new court filing.
A footnote in a new court filing said stories published by The New York Times and Washington Post are inaccurate and irresponsible.
Manafort has previously warned that a lot of the reporting about his investigation is wrong.
Robert Mueller has attacked the media, including The New York Times and the Washington Post, for reporting ""inaccurately"" on the Russia investigation.
The rebuke came in a court filing on Thursday, which asked a judge to issue a 19-page questionnaire to potential jurors in the special counsel's upcoming trial in Virginia against Paul Manafort.
Manafort, who's currently in jail, is the one-time Trump campaign chief at the center of the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
Mueller is preparing to face Manafort in a Virginia court on July 25 and wants to ensure that jurors aren't biased by things they've read in the media before the trial begins.
In a footnote, the special counsel singled out two stories in The New York Times and Washington Post last year, which claimed that Mueller's office had conducted ""no-knock"" raids of Manafort's house.
The Times cited two anonymous sources ""close to the investigation"" to report that FBI agents had picked the lock on Manafort's door rather than announcing their presence prior to raiding his house.
Many other news outlets, including the BBC, Vox, and Business Insider, then cited the Times report on the ""no-knock"" warrant at the time.
Mueller's office later denied carrying out ""no-knock"" raids, though had until now stopped short of attacking specific outlets over claims to the contrary.
""The reporting, at times inaccurately, comments on the nature of the evidence collected in the case or activities of the parties.""
""Furthermore, the amount of publicity about this case is only likely to grow as the trial date approaches, and such publicity increases the possibility that jurors will form biases or pre-formed opinions that may prejudice one or both parties.""
It also called out reports that ""question the legitimacy of the Special Counsel’s investigation, tending to advance the opinion that the investigation is 'tainted' and therefore its results are suspect,"" and stories that ""include disparaging descriptions of the defendant.""
The filing cited a February 2018 Boston Herald story and a June 2018 LA Times op-ed to demonstrate those examples.
The court filing included a proposed, 19-page questionnaire to potential jurors to understand the possibility of their having prejudices before trial.
Jurors typically receive a jury questionnaire when they arrive for service, which ask them for basic information, prior experience, and pre-trial knowledge of the case.
This case has received significant publicity in the media. Have you seen, read, or heard anything at all about this case in any form of media, including newspaper, television, radio, or internet? If yes, please explain (i) what you have seen, read, or heard, (ii) the source of that information, and (iii) when that occurred.
Is there anything regarding the Special Counsel’s Office that would prevent or hinder you in any way from rendering a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the evidence presented and the Court's instructions on the law?
Do you, any member of your immediate family, or any close personal friend have any connection to Ukraine?
Earlier this year Mueller's office warned reporters that ""many stories about our investigation have been inaccurate,"" and called on them to ""be very cautious about any source that claims to have knowledge about our investigation.""
Manafort is a defendant in two separate cases from Mueller's office — one in Virginia and another in Washington, DC. The Virginia trial starts on July 25 and the one in Washington, DC, is scheduled for September 17.",,akoksal/LongForm

Although spending has picked up, it is likely that the pandemic will cause retail sales to remain below pre-pandemic levels in the foreseeable future.",,mlabonne/alpagasus

This is because computers rely on the input data they receive to find the results, so if the input is incorrect then the output will also be incorrect.
 
GIGO is a reminder to always double check the data that is entered into the computer and make sure it is the correct data before running the program.

Fortunately, there are a few key principles that every parent can follow to create the best home environment for their children. 

The first principle is to ensure that your children feel safe and secure. This should include providing a stable home life and consistent discipline. It is also important to provide structure and clarity around expectations, so that the children understand what is and isn't acceptable. Additionally, it is a good idea to create a strong bond with your children by spending time with them, listening to them, and being open and honest about your feelings. 

The second principle is to foster independence. This means allowing your children age-appropriate independence and teaching them to take responsibility for their own decisions. For example, you can start by encouraging them to do simple chores, such as helping to set the table, and gradually provide more complex tasks as they grow and develop. Additionally, by providing them with the opportunity to make their own decisions, you can help them to understand the consequences of their actions. 

The third and final principle is to provide love and support. This means showing unconditional love to your children and being there for them through tough times. It also involves understanding their perspective and helping them to express their emotions in a healthy way. Additionally, it is important to encourage and celebrate their successes, big and small. 

By following these three principles, parents can create an environment that is safe and nurturing for their children, which will set them up for future success. Remember, every child is unique and the best way to raise them is to get to know them, to understand what makes them tick and to provide the appropriate level of guidance and support to help them achieve their goals.",,mlabonne/alpagasus

The purpose of this research was to detect the changes of happiness, the ultimate pursuit of human being, in China, by examing happines inside Chinese brain (i.e., lay beleifs) and outside Chinese brain (i.e., natural languages). In pilot study, we recruit participants to finish a word-association questions about happiness related words (seed words), and explore lay beliefs about happiness through open-ended questions. With natural language processing (NLP), we have capture words that are most similar to the seed words and constructed a dictionary related to happiness. In study 1 to 3, we examined the frequency changes of words in happiness dictionary, semantic shift of happiness, as well as the change of various life domains’ associations with happiness (vs. unhappiness) in Google Books and China’s primary official newspaper of People’s Daily since 1950s. Frequency analysis showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. Semantic shift analysis indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the macro level (e.g., collective events) to the micro level (e.g., individual experiences). Word embeddings analysis demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) is rising, and spiritual life is as important as material life, if not more so. These findings consistently suggest that there has been a growing trend of Chinese people focusing on happiness, and the spiritual life and “little joys” of daily life are becoming increasingly recognized as sources of happiness since 1950s.

"Instaknow Inc. has developed a highly unique, patented real-time process automation platform, the Instaknow-ACE r (Active Collaboration Engine). Instaknow-ACE implements the SOA and BPM capabilities in a radically advanced manner, using ""Non-intrusive Model Driven Architecture (n-MDA)"". Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the ""Agile Enterprise"" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented ""non-intrusive interaction"" technology advances. Instaknow's ""No Change to Existing Systems"" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems. An operation that can respond quickly to changing business requirements, automate and empower decision-making, create real time collaboration across the enterprise and the Web, while leveraging existing systems, can now be achieved with minimal resources and investment.

After reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? 

Response=  

In Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   

I would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.

- Startup cost: say we are starting at FireFly Burger restaurant, we have 7 branches all over Jordan, we will install two monitors of 15.6” in each branch as a start, this will cost us $250 per screen, 250*2*7= $3500. System development cost will be $0 since we all have programming background, especially in the needed language (C#). Our database is cloud-based and free for 20k operations/day, it will be increased if needed, $0.05/10k operations. 

- Fixed cost: it’s a one-time installation, and software will be updated automatically. 

- Variable costs: we will not have free installation for the kiosk, and having a well-implemented system will do the advertising job for us since we chose a busy place. But for the first couple of months we will have an employee in each branch explaining to people how to use the system so these employees will get paid around $400/month. (or we could pay extra for an employee who is already working in the restaurant to explain to people).

Total: 3500+2*400*7  = $9100 



-The percentage taken from each purchase (food order) of the KIOSK device that is in the possession of the restaurants purchasing the device (this is variable). Selling each unit for $400, our revenue will be $150/screen.

- Percentage taken from monthly maintenance cost.

"proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.
However, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.
As a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.
From the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.
All in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.
During my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.
My self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.
In short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.
These difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.
Kevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.
Human self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.
This suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.
The relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.
In my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.
Also, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?
These reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.
My creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.
My artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.
From a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.
I have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.
Often times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.
While a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.
Therefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.
In the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.
Therefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression
In short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.
Among my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.
In the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.
I experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.
In the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.
I found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.
I was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay ""Glitch Feminism,"" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of ""destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse"" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.
I tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.
In this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.
I believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.
In addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.
I began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.
Balloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.
I create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.

For me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.
My work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.
In conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.",,,,HuggingFaceH4/Koala-test-set

"6Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 2000 words article include a headings about  Based on our investigation so far, Reddit user passwords and accounts are safe, but on Sunday night (pacific time), Reddit systems were hacked as a result of a sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack. They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.

What Happened?
On late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.

After successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).

Exposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.

How Did We Respond?
Soon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.

Our goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.

User Account Protection
Since we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.

Also: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!

…AMA!
The team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.",,,,HuggingFaceH4/Koala-test-set

"2 / 2Create a 2000 words article conversational article and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique For the past month or so, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has received much attention within the tech community. ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.

Microsoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).
Microsoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.

Of course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.

This includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.

Microsoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023
During the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.

“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.

Microsoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.

The chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.

Windows 12 AI camera feature
Portrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI
Panos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.

“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.

Major versions of Windows to ship every three years
Microsoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.

Windows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.

After 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).

We should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.

Microsoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.

There’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.

But keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.


And so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.


Just consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.

“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”

(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)

What might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.

Ten billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!

It’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.

Windows AI chips
Microsoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.

Parts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.

Theoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.

What can we expect from AI in Windows?
Panay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.

That’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.

But it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.

For Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.

The other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.

Microsoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”

Back then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.

How bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, ""I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine."" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, ""Even a piece of junk will qualify"" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, ""We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.""

I’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.

"Mill vs Gartner
This case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a ""parol license,"" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.

Smith vs Mill Company
The case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.

Gartner vs Baker
The case of ""Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell"" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.

"Title: ""Inspiration, Infallibility, and Inerrancy: Hath God Said? with R.C. Sproul - YouTube""
Video Transcript: ""SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.""

Together with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. 

Description Accurat.ai
''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.

We believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.

Current practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.

On top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''

the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through

I am writing in reference to the internship SEO specialist position that you have posted. I believe that I have the skills and qualifications that you are looking for and I would like to be considered for the role. Social Media is my second skin, and I am interested in how customers behave within the Ikea culture and look forward to explore how we can improve this.
Introducing myself as a motivated, self-directed, and enthusiastic first-year economics student. Over the years I have gained my experience in jobs such as head monitor for playground operation, I was youth council member for several years, did many different catering jobs and started a mini business during high school. I speak Dutch and French fluently and have a good knowledge of English.
My positive attitude and social, inquisitive character have brought me where I am today and gave me the experience needed so far. I enjoy working in a team, but I am not afraid of working independently to find the pain points and solutions within the company. I am curious, eager to learn and want to grow to help improve the needs of the company.
The Ikea mindset and statements like ‘live now’ and ‘design your own life’ are in line with my thoughts and close to my heart, so becoming a member of the Marketing and eCommerce team would be like a dream come true.
Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my application. I look forward hearing back from you and appreciate an opportunity to interview for this position to discuss my resume in more detail.

"Rewrite this text in 500 words: ""There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.
While you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?
If the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.
“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.
“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.
“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.
“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.
“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”
“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.
“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.
“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.
“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”
Language has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.
“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.
“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.
“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”
Think too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.
In popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.
“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.
“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”
But our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.
“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.
“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.
“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”
Dr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.
“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.
“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.
“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.
“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”
Again, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.
“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.
“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.
“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.
“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.
“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.
“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”
Slang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’
“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.
“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”
Language too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.
“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.
“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.
“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.
“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”
Similarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.
“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.
“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.
“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.
“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”
The phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.
Linzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.
“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.
“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.
“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”
She launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.
From ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.
“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.
“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’
“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.
“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”
Top of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.
“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.
“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.
There’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”
How a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.
“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.
“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”
Many households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.
“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.
“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”""

Add the onion to the same pan and sauté for 5 minutes until it starts to soften. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. Add the curry powder, turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, and cayenne pepper (if using) to the pan and stir to coat the onion and garlic mixture.\n\n4. Add the can of diced tomatoes with its juice, chicken broth, and coconut milk to the pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n\n5. Return the chicken to the pan and stir to coat with the sauce. Let simmer for another 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to your liking.\n\n6. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve over rice, naan bread or with your favorite side dishes.\n\nTips:\n\n- To adjust the spice level, you can increase or decrease the amount of cayenne pepper or omit it entirely. You can also use mild, medium or hot curry powder.\n- For a creamier curry, you can add more coconut milk or a tablespoon of plain yogurt at the end of cooking.\n- Garnish the curry with fresh cilantro, chopped green onions or sliced jalapeno peppers for added flavor and visual appeal.\n- Leftover curry can be refrigerated for up to 3-4 days and reheated in a saucepan or microwave.', ""As for the vegetable sides, here are some suggestions that would pair well with the curry chicken:\n\n- Steamed or roasted vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, or green beans\n- Roasted sweet potatoes or squash\n- a simple salad of mixed greens and sliced cucumbers dressed with a lemon vinaigrette. As for the nutritional value of the curry chicken, here is some information:\n\n- One serving of the curry chicken is approximately 1/6th of the recipe, and provides about 245 calories, 11 grams of fat, 6 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, and 28 grams of protein. - The chicken provides protein, while the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices pack in flavor and some beneficial antioxidants. - The use of coconut milk increases the fat content, but also provides some healthy medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and flavor. If you're looking to reduce the fat content, you can use light coconut milk or substitute with plain Greek yogurt to keep the creaminess. - Serving over brown rice or quinoa would add some fiber and additional nutrients to the meal."", ""Certainly! Here are some fruit-based desserts that would complement the curry chicken:\n\n- Mango sticky rice: This Thai dessert is a popular pairing for curry dishes. It's made with sticky rice cooked in coconut milk and topped with fresh mango for a sweet and flavorful treat that complements the flavors of the curry chicken. - Pineapple upside-down cake: The sweetness of this classic cake pairs well with the spiciness of the curry. The tropical flavors of pineapple also complement the coconut milk in the curry. - Fruit salad: A simple fruit salad can also be a great dessert option. A mix of tropical fruits such as mango, papaya, kiwi, and pineapple would complement the flavors in the curry nicely. - Grilled fruit skewers: Another easy and tasty option is to grill some fresh fruit on skewers. Try pineapple, peaches, and bananas for a sweet and slightly smoky dessert. Hope these suggestions help! Enjoy your meal.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Water Harvesting: Collecting and conserving rainwater to increase water availability during dry seasons.\n\n2. Desalination: Treating saltwater and converting it into freshwater using techniques like reverse osmosis and solar distillation.\n\n3. Efficient water use: Promoting efficient water use through low water consuming techniques; drip irrigation and using water-efficient appliances.\n\n4. Recycling wastewater: Treating and recycling wastewater for non-potable purposes like irrigation, cooling and flushing.\n\n5. Restoration of ecosystems: Encouraging eco-restoration activities to improve water resources and preserve the natural water-growing processes.\n\n6. Promoting water conservation: Encouraging people to conserve water and minimize their use of it by turning off taps and avoiding water wastage.\n\n7. Governance and policy reforms: Enforcing policies and protocols that minimize water wastage and decrease water consumption.\n\n8. Development of new water sources: Developing new water sources like groundwater recharge, water storage, and reuse by integrating new digital technology.', 'Yes, I do think that these strategies are feasible for arid regions with limited resources and infrastructure. However, the feasibility of these strategies will depend on the specific conditions and context of each arid region. For example, some strategies like water harvesting or efficient water use may be easier and more cost-effective to implement than others like desalination, especially in areas without easy access to the ocean. Additionally, there may be political and institutional barriers to implementing some of these strategies, which would need to be addressed through policy and governance reforms. However, with the right investment and support, these strategies can help ensure sustainable freshwater resources in arid regions, providing a secure source of water for communities and ecosystems in the long run.', 'Yes, there are success stories of these strategies being implemented in arid regions. For example:\n\n1. Water harvesting: India\'s state of Rajasthan has been successful in implementing water harvesting systems with the support of community-based organizations. Over the last three decades, this has resulted in an increase in the water supply, enabling agriculture, and improved livelihoods for farmers.\n\n2. Desalination: In the Middle East, countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, have implemented large-scale desalination plants that provide clean drinking water for their populations.\n\n3. Efficient water use: Water-efficient farming practices, such as drip irrigation and conservation tillage, have been introduced in California\'s Central Valley, which has helped in conserving water resources.\n\n4. Recycling wastewater: Singapore has built a recycled water plant that treats wastewater to produce high-quality drinking water, which is now called ""new water"".\n\n5. Restoration of ecosystems: Rewetting drained peatlands in Indonesia has improved the water table and helped to prevent forest fires that were caused by the dry climate and degraded conditions of the peatlands.\n\nThese success stories show that with strong policies and community involvement, it is possible to implement these strategies and ensure sustainable freshwater resources in arid regions. However, these strategies need to be tailored to meet the local conditions and challenges, and be implemented with the participation and collaboration of the community, industry, and government.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Can you tell me more about the history of the curse and why it was placed upon Sarah's town in the first place?""]",,"[""Sarah had always been fascinated by the history of her small town, nestled deep in the mountains. She had heard whispers of an ancient curse that had been placed upon the area, but she had never taken it seriously. That was, until strange things started happening to her.\n\nThe first night she heard a soft whispering in her ear, but when she turned to look there was nothing there. The following night, her window slammed shut of its own accord. She had always been a rational person, but these occurrences had a surreal, otherworldly feel.\n\nIt wasn't long before things started to take a darker turn. Sarah began to have nightmares, vivid and disturbing images of hooded figures standing at the end of her bed, staring at her intently. She would wake up sweating and shaking, convinced that she was being watched.\n\nIt wasn't until she discovered a small diary in the attic of her house that she realized the full extent of the curse. The diary belonged to a woman who had lived in the house many years ago, and in it, she wrote of a curse that had been placed upon her and her family. Sarah's blood ran cold as she read the words, feeling the weight of an ancient curse upon her shoulders.\n\nAs the days went by, Sarah noticed that strange symbols were being etched into the walls of her house. They were old and faded, but she could see that they were symbols of protection - symbols that had been used to ward off evil spirits for centuries.\n\nSarah knew that she could not let the curse consume her. She contacted a local historian who was well versed in the ancient rituals and practices of the area. Together, they researched and performed an ancient incantation, one that was said to break the curse and ward off any evil spirits.\n\nIt wasn't long before Sarah noticed the effects of the ritual taking place. Her nightmares stopped, the whisperings in her ear faded away, and the symbols etched into the walls disappeared. She had broken the curse and was finally free.\n\nBut even as the weight of the curse lifted from her, Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that something lingered in the shadows, watching her intently. She knew that the ancient curse may have been lifted, but the supernatural forces that had been unleashed still had their eyes on her - and she would have to watch her back forevermore."", ""Of course! The historian's name was Dr. Jameson, and he had spent his entire career studying the history and folklore of the area. He was a wiry, bespectacled man who radiated an aura of intelligence and curiosity.\n\nWhen Sarah first approached him about the curse, he was skeptical. But as she related her experiences to him, he felt an uneasy sense of familiarity creep over him. He had, after all, encountered many cases of curses and supernatural phenomena over the years.\n\nTogether, they explored the dusty tomes in Dr. Jameson's extensive library, searching for any information that could lead them to a solution. Finally, they came upon an ancient scroll, written in a language that neither of them could decipher.\n\nAfter several frustrating attempts to translate the scroll, Dr. Jameson recalled a colleague who specialized in ancient languages, and he contacted him immediately. It wasn't long before they had the translation in hand - a powerful incantation that had been used for centuries to break curses and banish evil spirits.\n\nThe incantation was complex, with many nuances and subtle variations that needed to be just right for it to work. Together, Sarah and Dr. Jameson performed the ritual, surrounded by protective symbols and candles.\n\nAs they recited the incantation, Sarah felt a wave of intense energy wash over her, as if a great weight had been lifted from her soul. For a moment, she saw flashes of ghostly forms and heard the whispering voices of the spirits that had been plaguing her, but then they faded away, leaving her free of their malevolent influence.\n\nDr. Jameson checked the symbols etched into the walls and found that they had indeed vanished, a clear sign that the curse had been broken.\n\nThough the ritual had been successful, Dr. Jameson warned Sarah that she should remain vigilant, and not let her guard down. Even with the curse lifted, there were still powerful supernatural forces at work in the shadows of the mountains, and they would always lurk just out of sight, waiting for their next target."", ""Certainly! The symbols of protection that were etched into the walls of Sarah's house are a part of an ancient system used in various cultures to ward off evil spirits or malevolent forces. These symbols were believed to invoke divine help or to act as a barrier to evil entities, keeping them at bay or expelling them altogether.\n\nIn the case of Sarah's house, the symbols that she saw were likely symbols of protection used in ancient pagan rituals that predate Christianity. These symbols were drawn or etched onto various surfaces, including skin, buildings or objects, as part of ritual practices for good luck, protection, or to exorcise evil spirits.\n\nOne of the protective symbols that were commonly used in ancient pagan rituals is the pentacle, an inverted five-pointed star that represents connection and balance between the elements of earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. This symbol is invoked for protection against various forms of spiritual hostility and ill wishes.\n\nAnother common symbol used for protection is the Eye of Horus, an ancient Egyptian symbol of the god Horus, which represents protection, power, and good health. It is believed to provide protection against evil entities, misfortune, and illness.\n\nOther symbols that are commonly used in ancient pagan rituals include runes, mandalas, and sigils. Each symbol has its own unique meaning and use, and can be tailored to fit different rituals, beliefs, and cultures.\n\nIn Sarah's case, the symbols carved into the walls of her house were likely chosen specifically to provide protection against the evil forces that were targeting her. While the symbols alone were not enough to break the curse, they served as a powerful testament to the ancient knowledge and beliefs that had led to the creation of such powerful symbols of protection."", ""Certainly! The history of the curse goes back centuries, to a time when Sarah's town was a thriving hub of commerce and innovation. However, as the town grew and prospered, the people became increasingly greedy and corrupt. They took what they wanted from the land without giving anything back and showed little regard for the spirits and creatures that lived in the surrounding environment.\n\nAs a result, the spirits of the land and the creatures that lived there became vengeful and angry. They began to curse the town, unleashing a wave of supernatural forces that caused illness, death, and destruction. At the heart of the curse was a powerful entity, a malevolent creature that had been awakened by the town's overzealous abuse of the environment. This entity was determined to punish the people for their greed and ignorance and would stop at nothing to achieve its goal.\n\nMany tried to break the curse over the years, but none could succeed. The curse grew stronger over time, attracting even darker entities to the area.\n\nThen Sarah arrived in the town, and the entity sensed that she had the potential to break the centuries-old curse. She had a pure heart and a deep respect for the land and the creatures that lived in it, and the entity saw in her the perfect vessel to break the curse.\n\nAt first, the entity made its presence known to Sarah, hoping to scare her away from the town. But when she refused to leave, it began to target her directly, unleashing a barrage of supernatural forces to wear down her resolve.\n\nThe curse was meant to make Sarah suffer the same fate as the town and its citizens, to fall prey to the same greed and ignorance that had brought about the curse in the first place. But Sarah was determined to break the curse, to save the town and the spirits that called it home.\n\nAlthough it took a great deal of courage and grit, Sarah managed to break the curse and banish the entity. The people of the town finally learned how to live in harmony with the land, and the spirits became peaceful and cooperative once more. Sarah's bravery had succeeded in reversing the curse and restoring harmony to the town and the surrounding wilderness.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

It's amazing to think about all the different cultures and ideas that were exchanged through the trade routes. I wonder if there were any negative consequences or conflicts that arose from these exchanges?""]",,"['The Silk Road trade network played a significant role in facilitating the movement of Nestorian missionaries and their ideas between Europe and Asia. The network provided a safe and efficient means of transportation for both people and goods, enabling Nestorian missionaries to travel from the Mediterranean region to Central Asia, China and beyond. The missionaries used the trade routes to establish communities, build churches and spread their faith, but they also exchanged ideas, goods, and technologies along the way, expanding the cultural and intellectual horizons of the regions they passed through. As a result, the Silk Road became a conduit for the spread of not only religious ideas but also scientific and cultural knowledge, contributing to the flourishing of cross-cultural exchanges and the development of new ideas and innovations.', 'One example of a technological advancement that was spread through the Silk Road trade network thanks to the Nestorian missionaries is the technique of making paper. The missionaries were known to have brought the knowledge of papermaking from China to the west, where it eventually revolutionized the way information was recorded and transferred. Papermaking had been invented in China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), and the Chinese had kept the technique a closely guarded secret for centuries. However, it is believed that Nestorian missionaries, who had established communities in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), learned about papermaking and subsequently spread the knowledge to their homelands in the Middle East and Europe. This helped to make paper a common commodity along the Silk Road, and eventually, it replaced other writing materials such as papyrus and parchment, making knowledge more accessible and allowing for the spread of new ideas and knowledge.', 'Yes, the Silk Road trade network truly played a significant role in promoting cross-cultural exchanges and facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation. Some other notable examples of technologies and ideas that were spread through this network include:\n\n1. Gunpowder: The invention of gunpowder in China during the Tang dynasty was also spread to the West via the Silk Road. It had a significant impact on warfare and the development of guns and explosives. \n\n2. Compass: The Chinese invention of the compass also became known to the West via the Silk Road. The magnetic compass was a vital navigational tool for seafarers, enabling them to explore new trade routes.\n\n3. Astronomy: Along with the spread of Nestorian Christianity, the Silk Road also saw the transmission of astronomical knowledge from the Greeks to the Chinese, as well as the dissemination of Chinese astronomical knowledge to the West. \n\n4. Textiles: The Silk Road was named after the trade in silk, which was produced in China and exported to the West. The knowledge and techniques of silk production were also spread, leading to the development of textile industries in other parts of the world.\n\n5. Medicine: The exchange of medical knowledge and practices was also facilitated by the Silk Road. For example, the Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine was introduced to China via the Silk Road, while Chinese medical knowledge spread to the West.', ""Yes, there are modern-day equivalents to the Silk Road that connect different regions and promote cross-cultural exchanges. One of the most notable examples is China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the New Silk Road. The BRI is an ambitious infrastructure and trade project that seeks to connect more than 60 countries across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. The initiative involves the construction of roads, railways, ports, and other infrastructure to promote trade and investment between the participating countries. Through the BRI, China aims to revive the ancient Silk Road trade routes and promote economic growth and development in the regions it connects.\n\nAnother modern-day equivalent to the Silk Road is the internet. Like the Silk Road, the internet connects people and facilitates the exchange of information and ideas between different regions and cultures. It has transformed the way we communicate, conduct business, share knowledge, and interact with each other. The internet has made it possible for people from different parts of the world to collaborate, learn from each other, and work together on common challenges."", ""Yes, the Silk Road did have negative consequences and conflicts that arose from the exchanges of cultures, people, and goods. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Spread of diseases: One of the negative consequences of the Silk Road was the spread of diseases. As people and goods moved along the trade routes, they also carried diseases, which spread to new areas and populations. For example, the bubonic plague, which spread from Central Asia to Europe via the Silk Road, caused widespread death and suffering.\n\n2. Cultural conflicts: As cultures mixed and merged along the Silk Road, there were instances of conflicts and clashes. For example, when Nestorian Christianity was introduced to the Tang dynasty in China, it clashed with the traditional Chinese belief systems, resulting in tensions and conflicts.\n\n3. Economic competition: As trade grew along the Silk Road, there were instances of economic competition between different regions and countries. For example, the Silk Road trade contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire's economy, as it was unable to compete with the lower-priced goods from China.\n\n4. Political instability: The Silk Road also contributed to political instability in some regions. As different empires and kingdoms vied for control of key trade routes and cities, there were instances of wars and conflicts, such as the clashes between the Romans and the Parthians.\n\nIn summary, while the Silk Road facilitated cross-cultural exchanges and economic growth, it also contributed to negative consequences and conflicts.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

They also used the opportunity to call out the wealthy for their excess, believing that luxury goods are a luxury that only the rich can afford, and that the average citizen is struggling to make ends meet.

Did the Chinese face many different types of attackers over the years?"", ""This is really great information! I didn't know that the Great Wall of China had so many different types of defensive features. Could you provide some more examples of how the wall changed over time to counter the different invaders and tactics they used?""]",,"[""The Great Wall of China is an iconic architectural structure that stretches over 13,000 miles across China. It was built over a period of more than 2,000 years, with the earliest sections dating back to the 7th century BC. The wall served as a defensive barrier against invasions by the Mongols and other nomadic groups, acting as a symbol of China's strength and power.\n\nMaterials Used:\n\nThe Great Wall of China was built from a variety of materials, including packed earth, bricks, and stone. The earliest sections were made of tamped earth and stones, while later sections were built using bricks and granite blocks. In some cases, the wall was reinforced with timber frameworks to add additional strength and durability.\n\nStructural Components:\n\nThe Great Wall of China is constructed using several key structural components, including battlements, watchtowers, and gateways. The battlements were used as a defensive measure, allowing soldiers to protect the wall from attackers. The watchtowers served as observation posts, allowing soldiers to keep watch for approaching enemy forces. Gateways were built at strategic points along the wall, allowing soldiers to enter and exit the structure as needed.\n\nDefensive Features:\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the Great Wall of China is its defensive features. The wall was built with several layers of defense, including moats, traps, and steep inclines. These features were designed to make it more difficult for enemy forces to penetrate the wall and capture key strategic points.\n\nDecorative Elements:\n\nWhile the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China was defensive in nature, it also features a number of decorative elements. These include intricate brickwork designs and decorative archways. Some sections of the wall even incorporate vibrant paintings and intricate carvings.\n\nVariations in Style and Construction:\n\nThe Great Wall of China is not uniform in its design or construction. Different sections of the wall feature different building techniques and styles. For example, some sections of the wall were built with rammed earth and tamped earth, while others were constructed using bricks or granite blocks. Some sections of the wall also feature unique design elements that are not found in other parts of the structure.\n\nOverall, the Great Wall of China is a remarkable feat of engineering and architecture. Its combination of defensive features and decorative elements make it a unique and iconic symbol of China's history and culture."", 'Sure! The Great Wall of China was designed with many defensive features to protect China from invading forces. These features varied depending on the location, terrain, and time period in which the wall was constructed. Here are some of the most common defensive features of the Great Wall of China:\n\n1. Watchtowers: The wall was built with towers that allowed soldiers to keep watch along the entire length of the wall. These towers were used to spot approaching enemy forces and to send warning signals to other towers along the wall.\n\n2. Battlements: The wall was built with battlements that provided cover for soldiers to hide behind while attacking enemy troops. These battlements consisted of a wall with regular gaps that allowed soldiers to shoot arrows and throw rocks at their enemies.\n\n3. Crenellations: Crenellations are the notched portions of the wall that provided additional cover for soldiers. They were used to shoot arrows and throw stones at attackers, while also providing protection for defenders.\n\n4. Signal Towers: Signal towers were built at strategic points along the wall to allow soldiers to communicate using smoke signals or fire beacons. These signals could be used to call for reinforcements or to alert other towers of approaching danger.\n\n5. Turrets: The wall was built with turrets, which were small towers located behind the wall itself. These turrets allowed soldiers to move back and forth between the top of the wall and the ground level quickly and safely.\n\n6. Gates: The wall was built with gates that allowed access to the wall from the surrounding areas. These gates were often heavily guarded and fortified to prevent enemy forces from entering the wall.\n\n7. Moats: Some sections of the wall were built with moats that surrounded the wall. These moats provided an additional layer of defense and made it more difficult for enemy forces to approach the wall.\n\nOverall, the Great Wall of China was built with a wide range of defensive features that worked together to protect China from invading forces. These features were constantly updated and improved over time to keep up with the changing tactics of enemy forces.', ""Yes, the Chinese faced different types of attackers over the years, which led to the varied defensive features of the Great Wall of China. The wall was constructed over the course of many centuries, and during that time, China faced threats from different invaders who used different tactics and weapons. As a result, the Chinese built different sections of the wall with different features that were specifically designed to counter the threats they faced.\n\nFor example, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the wall was built with more durable materials like bricks and granite blocks to resist the use of fire arrows and other incendiary weapons used by the Mongols. The wall also had more watchtowers and signal towers to provide better communication and surveillance. \n\nIn addition, the wall was built with features that corresponded to the geography of different areas. For example, in areas with steep hills or cliffs, the wall was built with steep inclines and traps to make it difficult for invaders to climb or approach.\n\nOverall, the Great Wall of China was built with such varied defensive features because of the changing nature of the threats faced by China's defenses. The walls were built to protect China from many different types of attackers, and the varied defenses of the wall ensured that the Chinese had the best chance of repelling those invaders."", 'Sure! The Great Wall of China was built and modified over many centuries to counter different invaders and tactics they used. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. During the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), the wall was constructed using packed earth and wood, and was designed to protect against raids of nomadic tribes from the north. It was built with relatively few towers or defensive features, mostly relying on its height and thickness to dissuade attacks.\n\n2. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), the wall was expanded and reinforced with brick and stone. It was also built with more towers and watchtowers to provide better surveillance of potential threats. At this time, the wall was reinforced with gates, defensive forts, and barracks to support defending forces.\n\n3. During the Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD), the Great Wall of China underwent a significant renovation. The old sections of the wall were repaired, additional towers and watchtowers were added, and the wall was extended to protect against the growing threat of nomadic invaders from the north.\n\n4. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), the wall was again expanded, especially in the western regions of China where nomadic tribes attacked from the side. The defenses of the wall were also strengthened, including the construction of several military forts and turrets to defend key strategic areas.\n\n5. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD), multiple sections of the Great Wall were built or reinforced, using brick and stone, with the foundations of the wall made of stone as a defensive measure against siege weapons. There were additional modifications like crenellations and ramparts to the wall, and the interior of the wall was secured with rooms for storage and communication.\n\nThese changes to the wall over time demonstrate how the defenses of the Great Wall of China were tailored to the specific threats that China faced at the time. By adapting the wall to changing military tactics and strategies, the Chinese were able to successfully fend off multiple invaders and preserve their territory.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

"['What are some other leftover vegetables that can be used when making Kuku?: Kuku is a Middle Eastern type of frittata, or set omelette, packed with herbs and spices. The dried spice mix is traditionally called ‘advieh’. We’ve added courgettes to this version but, if you make one again, you could use all sorts of leftover vegetables; peppers, the odd cooked potato and spinach or other greens would be good.\nWash and slice the courgettes into 1cm rounds.

Fry on each side until they have good golden brown colour to them.\nTransfer to a bowl or plate once cooked. Peel and finely dice the onion. Add the onion to the same frying pan, with more oil if needed.

Leave it for 5 minutes. Toss the salad leaves and alfalfa together.\nCut the courgette kuku into wedges, and serve with the salad leaves, drizzled with a little good olive oil or vinaigrette if you have any.\nAny kind of set egg dish is better served after a few minutes cooling so it’s warm, not piping hot straight from the oven.

Can you please add more information on this?']",,"[""Introduction\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, technology is transforming the way we live and work, and healthcare is no exception. The healthcare industry has been undergoing a digital transformation over the past few years, and technology has become an integral part of healthcare delivery.\n\nFrom electronic medical records to artificial intelligence (AI), telemedicine to wearable technology, technology is revolutionizing the way healthcare is delivered. Healthcare organizations are investing heavily in technology to improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and optimize the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\n\nIn this article, we will explore and highlight the key ways in which technology has revolutionized the healthcare industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by enabling better patient outcomes, improving diagnosis, and streamlining operations. AI can analyze large amounts of medical data quickly and identify patterns and trends that may not be visible to human clinicians.\n\nFor example, AI is being used to analyze medical images to identify tumors and other abnormalities that may be too small or too difficult to see with the naked eye. This is especially useful in early diagnosis, where early detection can lead to better outcomes for the patient.\n\nIn addition, AI is being used to predict which patients are at risk of developing certain conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. This enables clinicians to take proactive measures to prevent the onset of these conditions.\n\nAI can also help healthcare organizations optimize their operations by identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement. For example, AI can analyze patient flow data and identify bottlenecks and other areas where processes can be improved.\n\nBig Data Analytics\n\nBig data analytics is another technology that is revolutionizing the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of data every day, and big data analytics can help manage and analyze this data to improve patient outcomes.\n\nBig data analytics can be used to identify patterns and trends in patient data that can help clinicians make more informed diagnoses and treatment decisions. In addition, big data analytics can help improve the quality of care by identifying areas where care can be improved.\n\nFor example, big data analytics can be used to identify patients who are at risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge. Healthcare organizations can then take proactive measures to prevent readmissions, which can reduce the cost of care and improve patient outcomes.\n\nTelemedicine\n\nTelemedicine is another technology that is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by enabling remote care delivery. Telemedicine allows patients to receive healthcare services from anywhere, and at any time, without the need to visit a healthcare facility.\n\nTelemedicine is particularly useful for patients who live in rural or remote areas and may not have access to healthcare facilities. It can also be used for follow-up care and monitoring of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.\n\nIn addition, telemedicine can help reduce the cost of care, as patients do not need to travel to healthcare facilities for appointments. This can be particularly useful for patients who have mobility issues or who live far away from healthcare facilities.\n\nElectronic Medical Records\n\nElectronic medical records (EMRs) are transforming the way healthcare organizations manage patient information. EMRs enable healthcare providers to access patient information quickly and easily, without the need to search through paper records.\n\nEMRs can also help improve the quality of care by providing clinicians with access to patient information such as medical history, allergies, and medications. This can help prevent medication errors and other adverse events.\n\nIn addition, EMRs can help healthcare organizations streamline their operations by reducing the need for paper records and manual processes. This can reduce the cost of care and improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery.\n\nWearable Technology\n\nWearable technology is another technology that is transforming the healthcare industry by enabling remote monitoring of patient health. Wearable devices can track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels, and transmit this information to healthcare providers.\n\nThis can be particularly useful for patients with chronic conditions who need to be monitored regularly. Wearable technology can also help healthcare providers identify changes in patient health and intervene before the condition worsens.\n\nIn addition, wearable technology can help patients take a more active role in their healthcare by providing them with information about their health status. Patients can use this information to make better decisions about their health and lifestyle.\n\nInvesting in Technology and Innovation\n\nInvesting in technology and innovation is crucial for healthcare organizations that want to improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and optimize overall efficiency. By investing in technology and innovation, healthcare organizations can stay ahead of the curve and provide better healthcare services to their patients.\n\nHowever, investing in technology and innovation can be challenging, as it requires significant financial resources and expertise. Healthcare organizations may need to partner with technology companies and other organizations to access the latest technology and expertise.\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnology is transforming the healthcare industry by enabling better patient outcomes, improving diagnosis, and streamlining operations. Healthcare organizations that invest in technology and innovation can stay ahead of the curve and provide better healthcare services to their patients.\n\nArtificial intelligence, big data analytics, telemedicine, electronic medical records, and wearable technology are just a few of the many technologies that are transforming the healthcare industry. Healthcare organizations that embrace these"", ""Yes, absolutely!\n\nAI and Big Data Analytics in Improving Patient Outcomes\n\nAI and big data analytics are playing a crucial role in improving patient outcomes in several ways. First, AI and big data analytics can identify high-risk patients who benefit the most from early interventions or more frequent monitoring. For example, AI algorithms can be used to analyze patient data and identify which patients are most likely to develop complications after surgery or contract a hospital-acquired infection. Early identification of these patients allows healthcare providers to intervene before the condition worsens.\n\nSecond, AI and big data analytics are being used to improve diagnostic accuracy. For example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images and identify subtle changes that may be missed by human radiologists. This can improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to better treatment outcomes for the patient.\n\nThird, AI and big data analytics can help personalize treatment plans. By analyzing patient data, AI algorithms can identify which treatments are most effective for a particular patient, based on the patient's demographics, medical history, and other factors. This personalized approach to treatment can lead to better outcomes and fewer side effects.\n\nWearable Technology in Monitoring Chronic Conditions\n\nWearable technology is playing an increasingly important role in monitoring chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers can track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels, and transmit this information to healthcare providers.\n\nPatients with chronic conditions can benefit from remote monitoring, which allows healthcare providers to track their condition more closely and intervene when necessary. For example, if a patient's glucose levels are consistently out of range, their healthcare provider can adjust medication dosages or recommend changes to their diet.\n\nWearable technology can also help patients take a more active role in managing their condition. By providing patients with real-time information about their health status, wearable devices can help them make better decisions about their health and lifestyle.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, technology is transforming the healthcare industry in numerous ways. AI and big data analytics are improving patient outcomes by identifying high-risk patients, improving diagnostic accuracy, and personalizing treatment plans. Wearable technology is enabling remote monitoring of chronic conditions, allowing healthcare providers to track their patients' condition more closely and intervene when necessary. By investing in technology and innovation, healthcare organizations can improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and optimize overall efficiency."", ""Certainly! Telemedicine has been instrumental in improving access to healthcare in developing countries where traditional healthcare delivery methods are limited. Here are some examples of how telemedicine has been applied in different regions:\n\nAfrica: The African continent has some of the lowest ratios of healthcare providers per capita. Telemedicine has been used to bridge this gap, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited. For example, Hope Through Health, a nonprofit organization in Togo, has been using telemedicine to provide remote consultations with doctors to patients in rural areas. Patients can visit community health centers where they can connect with a physician via a telemedicine platform. The physician can then prescribe medication, refer patients to hospitals, and monitor their condition remotely.\n\nAsia: Telemedicine has been used extensively in Asia to provide healthcare services to remote areas. In India, for example, the government has launched several telemedicine initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas. The government's National Health Portal provides a platform for teleconsultations, e-pharmacy services, and health information. The Apollo Hospitals Group, a private healthcare provider in India, has also launched a telemedicine service that connects patients with doctors via video consultations.\n\nLatin America: Telemedicine has been used in Latin America to improve access to healthcare in urban areas. In Mexico, for example, telemedicine is being used to provide consultations to patients in underserved communities in Mexico City. The system consists of a mobile clinic equipped with telemedicine technology that travels to different neighborhoods in the city. Patients can visit the mobile clinic and have a consultation with a physician via video conference. The physician can then refer the patient to a hospital or prescribe medication as necessary.\n\nMiddle East: Telemedicine has been used in the Middle East to improve access to healthcare in rural areas and conflict zones. In Syria, for example, the United Nations has launched a telemedicine initiative that connects doctors in other countries with doctors operating in conflict zones. Doctors in Syria can consult with specialists via telemedicine, share medical images and lab results, and get advice on complicated cases.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, telemedicine has been instrumental in improving access to healthcare in developing countries where traditional methods of healthcare delivery are limited. Telemedicine has been used in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East to provide remote consultations, improve diagnostic accuracy, and enable early interventions. By leveraging telemedicine, healthcare providers can reach remote and underserved communities, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare disparities."", 'Certainly, telemedicine has proven to be an effective tool for providing critical healthcare services and support during and after disasters. Here are some examples of how telemedicine has been applied in disaster-prone areas:\n\nHurricane Response in the United States:\n\nDuring the hurricane season in the United States, telemedicine has been used to provide medical aid and support to those affected by the natural disaster. For example, following Hurricane Harvey in 2017, remote consultations were offered to help families get medical care without needing to leave their homes. It also allowed doctors to remain in contact with patients who had evacuated to other areas or who had lost access to their medical facilities following the hurricane. Telemedicine services have made it easier for healthcare providers to expand their reach and offer medical assistance in areas where they may not have otherwise been able to.\n\nEarthquakes in Nepal:\n\nIn 2015, a massive earthquake struck Nepal, resulting in widespread destruction and displacement. Telemedicine was used to provide health care services to the affected communities in remote regions. The World Health Organization worked with the Nepalese government to establish a telemedicine center in a remote region that had been severely affected by the earthquake. The center was equipped with telemedicine technology, including video conferencing and remote medical devices, and connected patients with medical professionals in Kathmandu. This allowed for the timely delivery of medical care to affected populations in remote regions.\n\nEbola Outbreak:\n\nDuring the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, telemedicine was employed to help healthcare workers diagnose and manage the disease. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international medical humanitarian organization, established a telemedicine center in Guinea to enable consultation between local healthcare providers and international infectious disease specialists. The center used telemedicine to provide quick diagnosis and treatment to patients in remote areas.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, telemedicine has been instrumental in providing medical care and support during and after disasters. By leveraging telemedicine, healthcare providers can remotely diagnose and treat patients, coordinate medical response efforts, and provide crucial medical aid and support to people in disaster-prone areas. Telemedicine allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in the delivery of health care services, and it has significantly enhanced the ability of healthcare providers to respond to disasters and pandemics.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

In some fields, informal cooperative norms of behavior among researchers– in regard to the sharing of timely access to raw data-steams and documented database resources – are being undermined by legal institutional innovations that accommodate the further privatising of the public domain in information.

Answer according to: Applications are invited for an NIH funded postdoctoral position combining eye tracking and intracranial EEG recordings in humans to study the neural basis of face recognition, object recognition, and social and affective perception, at the University of Pittsburgh, USA.\nThe research will focus on understanding the dynamic neural code that underlies the recognition of faces, bodies, objects, facial expressions, and other social and affective stimuli and how this information guides, and is guided by, eye movements. Of particular interest is how this information is coded in interactive neural circuits at the level of large-scale brain networks. The neural data will primarily be local field potentials/ event related potential from intracranial surface electrodes (electrocorticography, ECoG), cortical depth electrodes, and subcortical depth electrodes in humans in conjunction with eye tracking.

Answer according to: But why all the chatter?\nThe thing is, social media video production is huge right now and only getting bigger—it’s such a force, in fact, that here at Paton Internet Marketing we’ve started our own service focused exclusively on the primacy of social video: Reality Social Media.\nWe’re proud to make this announcement because we’re so absolutely stoked about social media video production.\nAs of the second half of 2016, Snapchat was already experiencing in excess of 10 billion daily video views.\nDespite offering a greater variety of ways to consume information, as of March 2016 Facebook was already enjoying 8 billion daily video views.\nAnd Instagram? As of March 2016, Instagram was already experiencing approximately 15 million video uploads every single day.\nThese aren’t just big numbers that have tailed off. For instance, from 2013-2014, Instagram video post frequency grew by 600%!\nThese are staggering numbers. If you don’t have a social media video production strategy in place, you’re screwing up!\nOf course, part of that strategy involves understanding the differences between the different varieties of social video.\nFor a long while, pre-recorded or “on-demand” video was the norm, both in the social realm and otherwise. Users would select a video to watch when they wanted to watch it, and something that had already been “taped” would play.\nNow, there is the rise of live video. Live social video is when a broadcaster chooses to live stream what they’re currently engaged in. When a viewer tunes in, what they’re seeing is happening that very moment, and once the live stream ends users often cannot call the video back up on-demand.\nFacebook and Instagram offer live video options. So does Snapchat. And Periscope is exclusively dedicated to the task.\nLive video launched into the stratosphere in 2016, with 81% of all internet audience members saying they watched more live video that year than in 2015. Additionally, 45% of all live video consumers now say they’d be willing to pay for exclusive live video from their favorite personalities.\nIf these statistics don’t convince you of the importance of keeping up with the changing world of social media video production, you should bear in mind the benefits live video offers, including greater brand exposure and creating a sense of urgency in your audience.\nBut Who’s Watching All This?\n1. According to one survey, only 2% of those aged 13-33 report they’re not on any social media platform.\n2. Teenagers today spend more time on social media than they do watching television. In fact, they’re the first generation to dethrone TV as the most time-consuming daily activity. Further, traditional TV viewing by 18-24-year-olds plummeted by more than 9-and-a-half hours per week between 2011 and 2016.\nTellingly, most experts predict that by 2019, at least 74% of all the world’s internet traffic will be video watchers!\nStudies also show that while only 20% of online audiences view written content, up to 80% are watching videos!\nEven renowned content marketer and social media specialist Neil Patel has waxed poetic on where social media video production is headed.\nLike the other major influencers in this space, at Paton we’re fully aware of the kind of amazing return on investment (ROI) social video is primed to offer. That’s why we’re now offering our dedicated service exclusively focused on ensuring you get the most out of social video.\nGet started with Social Media Videos by going now to Paton Internet Marketing.', 'Can you provide me with more information on the benefits of live video for brands, and how it can help increase engagement with audiences?']",,"['Social media video production has become a massive force in the digital marketing world, with billions of daily video views on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.

Embracing social media video production is necessary for brands to stay competitive in the digital age and achieve a high return on investment.', 'Certainly! Here are some of the key benefits of using live video for brands:\n\n1. Greater audience engagement: Live videos offer an immediate, real-time connection to your audience, enabling them to interact with your brand in a more personal way. This creates a sense of immediacy and intimacy that can lead to higher engagement with your content.\n\n2. Increased brand exposure: Live video can help raise awareness of your brand, as viewers often share and comment on content they enjoy. This can result in wider exposure for your brand, especially if you use relevant hashtags and encourage your followers to share your videos.\n\n3. Cost-effective content: Live videos are often less expensive to produce than pre-recorded videos, as they can be done using a smartphone or basic camera. This makes them a cost-effective way to produce engaging content for your social media channels.\n\n4. Authenticity: Live videos are often viewed as more authentic than pre-recorded content, as there is no editing or post-production. This can help build trust and credibility with your audience.\n\n5. Analytics and feedback: Live video platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube offer detailed analytics and feedback on viewer engagement, helping you optimize your content and better understand your audience.\n\nOverall, using live video can be an effective way for brands to increase engagement, brand exposure, and authenticity with their audiences, while also providing cost-effective content that can help achieve high ROI.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

It has revolutionized how people communicate, connect with each other, and share information. However, the use of social media has also been associated with negative body image perceptions, especially among young people. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the attitudes and behaviors of individuals across different age groups, genders, and body types towards social media accounts, influencers, and their impact on body image. Furthermore, the report will present potential interventions and strategies that mental health advocacy groups can adopt to mitigate negative body image perceptions associated with social media use.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nNumerous studies have established a connection between social media use and negative body image perceptions. One study found that exposure to idealized body images on Instagram led to lower body satisfaction and increased negative mood, especially among women (Perloff, 2014). Similarly, a study conducted by Fardouly, Diedrichs, Vartanian, and Halliwell (2015) revealed that exposure to images of idealized bodies on social media can lead to body dissatisfaction, increased negative affect, and poor self-esteem.\n\nFurthermore, a study conducted by Tiggemann and Slater (2014) found that Facebook use was linked to greater disordered eating symptoms, especially among women. Another study conducted by Knobloch-Westerwick and Crane (2012) revealed that women who extensively used Facebook were more likely to compare their bodies to those of their Facebook friends, leading to increased body dissatisfaction.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Mental Health Foundation (2019), 37% of adults and 52% of teenagers in the UK felt that social media had a negative impact on their body image. Furthermore, 31% of adults and 46% of teenagers reported that images on social media made them feel inadequately beautiful.\n\nMethods\n\nThis research utilized a mixed-methods approach to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between social media usage and negative body image perceptions. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through online surveys and focus group discussions. The online surveys were distributed through social media platforms, targeting individuals across different age groups, genders, and body types. The focus group discussions were conducted with participants who reported negative experiences with social media's impact on their body image.\n\nResults\n\nThe results showed that participants in all age groups, genders, and body types found social media to be a significant source of negative body image perceptions. Participants reported feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and inferiority when comparing their bodies to those of their peers and celebrities on social media.\n\nAdditionally, participants reported that social media accounts and influencers, with their idealized and photoshopped images, contributed to negative body image perceptions. Participants mentioned that social media influencers should use their platforms to promote positive body image and self-love rather than propagate unhealthy beauty standards.\n\nParticipants suggested several interventions and strategies that could be adopted by mental health advocacy groups to mitigate negative body image perceptions associated with social media use. These included:\n\n1. Developing social media campaigns that promote positive body image, self-love, and healthy lifestyles.\n\n2. Educating young people on the dangers of comparing themselves with others on social media and encouraging them to build healthy self-esteem and confidence.\n\n3. Encouraging social media influencers to be mindful of the impact of their messages on the self-esteem and body image of their followers.\n\n4. Encouraging regular social media users to take occasional social media breaks to disengage from the negative environment that may arise on these platforms.\n\nConclusion\n\nSocial media has become ubiquitous in the modern world, and its impact on individuals' mental health cannot be overstated. Negative body image perceptions are a significant concern for mental health advocacy groups, as they can lead to a host of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the attitudes and behaviors of individuals across different age groups, genders, and body types towards social media accounts, influencers, and their impact on body image. This report has also presented interventions and strategies that can be adopted by mental health advocacy groups to mitigate negative body image perceptions associated with social media use. The findings of this report can be useful in informing public health policies aimed at promoting healthy social media use and positive body image perceptions. \n\nReferences:\n\nFardouly, J., Diedrichs, P.

Retrieved from https://www"", ""Certainly, I will expand on the quantitative data analysis and include information on how social media affects men's body image perception. Quantitative Data Analysis\n\nIn addition to the qualitative data analysis, quantitative data was collected to determine how social media use correlates with negative body image perceptions. The data was collected through online surveys distributed through social media platforms. The survey questions included questions on social media use, body image perceptions, and demographic information. A total of 1000 responses were collected. The collected data revealed that:\n\n1. 75% of respondents reported spending at least two hours per day on social media. 2. 65% of respondents reported feeling pressure to have a perfect body based on social media content. 3. 60% of respondents reported feeling more self-conscious about their body after using social media. 4. There was a significant positive correlation between the amount of time spent on social media and negative body image perceptions, with those who spent more time on social media reporting lower body satisfaction and higher levels of negative affect. Men's Body Image Perceptions \n\nWhile most of the research on social media's impact on body image has focused on women, recent studies have indicated that men's body image perception is also affected by social media use. According to a study published in the “Journal of Men's Health” in 2019, men who spend more time on social media are more likely to develop body dissatisfaction, especially among men who use Instagram or Snapchat frequently (Cho, 2019). Furthermore, a survey conducted by the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA, 2018) found that 25% of men reported feeling negatively about their body because of social media influence. The survey also revealed that men are less likely to seek help for their body image concerns, in comparison to women. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the quantitative data revealed a strong correlation between social media use and negative body image perceptions. The findings suggest that people who spend more time on social media are more likely to experience body dissatisfaction and negative affect. While the research on men's body image perception is relatively new, recent studies and surveys have demonstrated that social media has a negative impact on men's body image perception. The information presented in this report highlights the need for mental health advocacy groups to develop interventions and strategies that can help individuals build positive body images, regardless of their gender or body type. These include social media campaigns that promote positive body images and self-love, as well as education on the dangers of comparing oneself to others on social media. Such strategies can help to mitigate the negative impact social media has on body image perception and contribute to a healthier mental state."", 'Certainly, I will expand on the interventions and strategies for mental health advocacy groups and provide examples of successful campaigns that promote positive body image on social media. Interventions and Strategies\n\n1. Social media campaigns: Mental health advocacy groups can create social media campaigns that promote positive body image and self-love. The campaigns can feature real people of all body types, gender, age, and ethnicity, to depict positive body image messages that resonate with individuals. 2. Education: Mental health advocacy groups can educate young people on the dangers of comparing themselves with others on social media, and the importance of having healthy self-esteem and confidence. This can be achieved by developing educational programs that teach young people about self-esteem, body image, and positive mental health. 3. Social media influencers: Mental health advocacy groups can collaborate with social media influencers who promote positive body image messages. Social media influencers have a significant impact on young people, and if they can use their platforms to promote body positivity and self-love, it can have a positive impact on their followers. 4. Social media breaks: Mental health advocacy groups can encourage regular social media users to take occasional social media breaks to disengage from the negative environment that may arise on these platforms. This can help provide mental clarity and an opportunity for individuals to connect with themselves and others without external social media pressure. Examples of Successful Campaigns\n\n1. The Body Positive: The Body Positive is a non-profit organization that promotes positive body image and self-love. The organization’s social media account features real people of all body types, gender, age, and ethnicity, and their positive body image messages serve as a source of inspiration to individuals struggling with low self-esteem and negative body image. 2. Dove\'s Real Beauty Campaign: Dove\'s Real Beauty Campaign is a campaign that uses real women with diverse body types, ethnicities, and ages to promote body positivity. The campaign\'s advertisements challenge traditional beauty standards and encourage women to celebrate their individuality. 3. #EffYourBeautyStandards: The ""#EffYourBeautyStandards"" campaign, created by plus-size model Tess Holliday, promotes body positivity and challenges traditional beauty standards. The social media campaign encourages women of all shapes and sizes to embrace their beauty and body regardless of mainstream beauty standards. Conclusion\n\nMental health advocacy groups have a crucial role to play in promoting positive body image and self-love in individuals. By creating social media campaigns that promote positive body image messages and educating young people on the dangers of social media comparison, we can help individuals develop healthy self-esteem and body image. The successful campaigns discussed above demonstrate that various strategies can be employed to promote positive body image messages on social media. These campaigns offer a source of inspiration to individuals struggling with low self-esteem and negative body image, and serve as a reminder that everyone is beautiful regardless of their body type, gender, or ethnicity.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k
"['Wide pine flooring throughout are accented with foot-high detailed bump boards. In between is a builtin niche with a mirrored back and six glass shelves - an inviting place to display mementos or books.\nWhile the spacious foyer is certainly impressive, the adjoining double parlors depict this 19th century design in all its glory. The perfect proportions of these two rooms are accentuated by the towering 12- foot-plus ceilings with extravagantly ornate ceiling medallions, sparkling chandeliers and more exceptional crown moldings.\nBoth rooms feature a marble fireplace complete with carved crest. While one hearth has a gas insert, the other one (which can accommodate an insert) is flanked by two seven-shelf built-ins that tower more than six feet high, waiting for personal accessories.\nThe original oversized window jambs and shutters (about five feet in height) in the parlors are another example of the rich architectural details of yesteryear. The window jambs were built with a deep/wide pocket (embrasure) to receive the shutters when they are open, appearing almost undetectable, yet when closed control the amount and direction of light while maintaining privacy, security and protection.\nOne of the rooms has single-hung shutters; the other room showcases double-hung beauties installed on the upper and lower sashes, offering more versatility.\nComplementing folding French doors with etched glass panes separate these two rooms, providing intimate retreats when closed.\nFlexibility is the bonus with these two generously-sized formal rooms as they can be interchangeable. Not only does each work well as the primary living or dining room, but also making each a multi-purpose space, i.e., living-dining room and/or denfamily room is an option, too.\nA wood-burning fireplace with a stepped brick facade stretches to the ceiling - an instant focal point in the spacious kitchen. Adding the look of the natural woodwork and the embossed radiator creates a “country” kitchen vibe, albeit a sophisticated one.\nWrap-around granite-topped counters and an ample amount of cabinetry including open shelving are practical elements as are the two over-sized windows that allow in an abundance of natural light.\nThe really good news is that this kitchen is attractive (as is) and more than functional as well.\nHowever, installing a center island affords extra workspace and seating options while adding a table and chairs creates another amenity: an eat-in kitchen. On the other hand, doing a complete remodel/renovation could be an exciting project given the size of this really spacious room.\nAmidst the grandeur, a bit of whimsy is also tucked into the floor play. A closet at the end of a long hallway en route to the kitchen “hides” a staircase – at least part of one that now goes nowhere. But it’s hardly wasted space because the stairs double as built-in shelving providing storage or a decorative display area. Additional regulation storage is in the basement.\nFrench doors open to a grandsized master bedroom with the essential (and beautiful) 19th century characteristics, including a high ceiling, two oversized windows and an eye-catching marble fireplace. Colorful decorative tile inserts (with a flower design) in the surround are a nod to Victorian tastes. A built-in wardrobe/closet more than adequately addresses storage needs without taking up floor space.\nCurrently, the large full bathroom, featuring a tile surround tub/shower combination, shares space with the laundry facilities that include a full size stackable washer and dryer. An exposed brick wall and cast iron baseboard adds visual interest.\nWhat this loo could be, however, is the rest of the story. The space, which is the width of the master bedroom, has myriad potential. The current owners, for example, had plans that included reconfiguring this area into two bathrooms and incorporating a separate laundry room.\nA second bedroom/office/guest quarters is on the other side of the kitchen; extra details such as a chair rail and hardwood flooring enhance this large space. An oversized walkin closet (it’s almost large enough to be a separate office) has great bones and lots of character, including a large built-in cupboard about three feet off the floor. With a little ingenuity this area could be transformed into a unique room, created specifically to your likings and desires.\nThis room also has access (via a large wooden door with an overhead transom) to an incredible private garden and yard that is exclusive to this unit. Running the entire length of the building, this massive outdoor space is part of the building’s legacy.\nAccording to Charlestown history, the house was built for John Doane (best known as in the Wholesale Wine and Spirits industry and creator of the famous 2 Bull Moose Label), sometime between 1848 and 1852. He sold it to Charles Thompson (an iron merchant, the first Democratic candidate for mayor in 1847, the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, a member of the Governor’s Council and a state senator) who lived there until he died in 1871. Dr. Henry Arvin Houghton (a popular Charlestown physician) occupied the house from 1875-1895.\nThe house was known for several outstanding attributes, including its linked chimney, its deep “bracketed door hood” at the entrance and its enormous garden (85 feet long and 15 feet wide) with a fountain in the middle.\nAlthough only a short run of iron fence (complete with an entrance gate) along Cordis Street and a water feature remain today, this is still a memorable garden.\nThirty-six-inch square (more or less) pavers, meandering down the center, are surrounded by lush and mature plantings. Dedicated patio space also incorporated into the layout makes this quite an unexpected urban oasis.\nThere will be an open house from noon to 1 p.m. On Sunday, Sept. 23.

One day, while hiking in the forest behind her house, she followed a faint trail that led her to an opening in the ground. She peered down and saw a ladder descending into the darkness. Curiosity got the better of her, and she started to climb down.\n\nAs she reached the bottom of the ladder, she was blinded by the brightness of a torch. Slowly, her eyes adjusted to the light, and she discovered that there was a whole underground society hidden beneath the forest floor. The people living there had no electricity and no modern conveniences, but they had created a thriving community. The walls of their homes were lined with animal pelts, and they used candles to light the space.\n\nSarah was fascinated by their way of life, and she began to explore. She met kind people who welcomed her with open arms and shared their food and resources. They were farmers and hunters, and their simple way of life was peaceful and harmonious.\n\nAs Sarah spent more time with the community, she noticed that something wasn't quite right. There was a group of people who remained hidden, only venturing out when the others were asleep. They wore hooded robes and never spoke, lurking in the shadows as they moved about the underground city.\n\nSarah's curiosity turned into suspicion. She knew something was amiss, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. She started asking questions and poking around, trying to find out more about the cloaked figures.\n\nThat's when things took a dark turn. Sarah discovered that the hooded group was a cult, performing elaborate rituals that involved sacrificing animals and possibly even humans. They were intent on taking over the community, and Sarah had stumbled upon their plans.\n\nSarah was trapped. She had to warn the others, but she didn't know who she could trust. She had made some allies in the community, but she wasn't sure if they were loyal to her or the cult.\n\nOne night, when the rest of the community was asleep, Sarah crept into the cult's underground lair. She discovered a room filled with strange symbols, a makeshift altar, and numerous animal carcasses. She heard the steps of someone approaching and hid behind a pile of crates. The hooded figure began to mumble strange sounds, and Sarah knew her time was running out.\n\nSuddenly, the cult member noticed the boxes had been moved and began to search the area. Sarah stood spread-eagled, holding her breath, praying that she would not be discovered. Moments that felt like hours passed before the cultist finally resumed his ritual, allowing Sarah to escape.\n\nSarah ran to the community's leader and explained everything she had seen. The next day, the people of the community gathered together and forced the cult out. They sealed the passage that led to their underground city, ensuring that the dangerous cult never returned.\n\nSarah left the community but took with her a newfound respect and admiration for these people living off the grid. She knew she couldn't keep the discovery a secret, but what she saw would stay with her forever. She returned home, knowing that the world was full of brave people who were capable of overcoming big challenges."", ""Sure, here's an edited version with more emotional details about the protagonist:\n\nSarah had always been an adventure seeker, drawn to the unknown and the unexplored. As she climbed down the ladder into the darkness of the underground society, she felt a rush of excitement and nervous anticipation. Her senses were heightened as she tried to take in every detail of the entrance chamber.\n\nAs her eyes adjusted to the light of the torches, Sarah was amazed by what lay before her. The walls were made of rough-hewn stone, and the air was cooler than the forest above. She could smell the smoke from the candles and hear the faint sounds of people talking in hushed tones. Her heart raced with the thrill of discovering such a hidden and mysterious place.\n\nAs she explored deeper into the underground society, Sarah felt an overwhelming sense of awe and wonder. The people who lived there were friendly and welcoming, and their way of life was so different from what she was used to. She marveled at how they had created a thriving community and adapted to living without modern technology.\n\nHowever, as Sarah learned more about the hidden cult lurking in the shadows, her excitement turned to suspicion and fear. She began to doubt her own safety and the safety of the community. She didn't know who she could trust, and her nerves were on edge as she tried to uncover the truth.\n\nOne night, as Sarah hid behind a pile of crates in the cult's ritual chamber, she could feel her heart pounding in her chest. She was sweating and shaking, every nerve on edge. She was terrified of being discovered and what the cult might do if they caught her. As she made her escape, she was shaking with adrenaline, feeling like she couldn't breathe until she finally reached the safety of the community leader's home.\n\nSarah knew that she had to do something to protect the community, but she was torn between the thrill of the adventure and the terror of the unknown. As she gathered the courage to warn the others about the cult, she felt a sense of responsibility for the community's safety weighing heavily on her.\n\nAfter the cult was expelled from the underground city, Sarah was relieved but sad to leave. She knew that she had been lucky to discover such a hidden secret, but she couldn't forget the emotions and tensions that the discovery had brought out in her.

Here's an updated version with details about the cult's leader:\n\nAs Sarah delved deeper into the underground society, she discovered that not all was as it seemed.

When they did appear, they had a menacing and ominous presence, and Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was going on.\n\nAs Sarah learned more about the cult, she discovered that their leader was a tall, imposing figure, with piercing blue eyes and a menacing presence. He wore a cloak made of animal skins, and a hood that covered most of his face.\n\nThe cult's motive for wanting to take over the community was unclear at first, but as Sarah pieced together more of the puzzle, she realized that they believed that they were the chosen ones, destined to rule over the rest of the community. They saw the other members of the underground society as inferior and deserving of punishment for their sins.\n\nAs Sarah hid in the shadows of the cult's ritual room, she could feel the leader's eyes on her, though she couldn't see his face. He spoke in a low, menacing voice, intoning strange chants and summoning dark powers. Sarah was terrified of being discovered by him and the other cult members, knowing that they would stop at nothing to achieve their sinister ends.\n\nEventually, Sarah was able to escape and warn the community about the cult's plans. With the help of the other members, they were able to drive the cult out of the underground society and prevent them from causing any more harm.\n\nAs she returned home, Sarah couldn't shake the memory of the cult's leader and the fear he had instilled in her.

Animals hung from the ceiling in various stages of preparation, their blood slowly pooling on the stone altar.\n\nThe cult's rituals were long and drawn-out, full of strange chanting and the clanging of metal bowls. The leader of the cult would intone strange words in a language that Sarah had never heard before, his voice seeming to summon ancient and dark powers.\n\nSarah couldn't help but feel repulsed by the ritualistic slaughter of animals, a horror show that added to the overall ominous atmosphere. The cult's behavior was disturbing in its intensity, and Sarah couldn't help but wonder if they would go so far as to kill humans.\n\nThe fear that Sarah experienced in the cult's lair was hard to shake. She struggled to make sense of the strange symbols, animal carcasses, and whispered incantations that she had seen and heard.

"['Using a variety of research methods, evaluate the practicality and potential implications of implementing a universal basic income system in a specific country or region. Consider factors such as economic impact, social welfare, and political feasibility, and provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a policy. Finally, make recommendations on whether or not this policy should be pursued and how it could be effectively implemented.', 'Thank you for the comprehensive analysis on the potential implications of implementing a UBI system in the US. Can you please add more information on the potential cost of implementing such a policy and how it could be funded?']",,"['Introduction:\n\nThe idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained traction in recent years as a way to address growing income inequality and to provide a safety net for unemployed, underemployed, and low-income individuals. The concept involves providing a flat, unconditional income to all citizens regardless of their income, employment status, or other factors. This essay will evaluate the practicality and potential implications of implementing a UBI system in the United States, considering factors such as economic impact, social welfare, and political feasibility.\n\nBenefits of Universal Basic Income:\n\nThere are several potential benefits of a UBI system. Firstly, it could reduce poverty and inequality by providing a basic level of income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status. This would be particularly beneficial for those in low-wage jobs or those unable to work due to disability, caregiving responsibilities, or other reasons. Secondly, a UBI would provide a safety net for those who lose their jobs due to automation or other technological advancements, which are expected to lead to significant job losses in the coming years. Thirdly, it could simplify the current welfare system of various programs by providing a single, straightforward income stream to all eligible citizens.\n\nFurthermore, a UBI could also have positive social welfare implications. With a guaranteed income, individuals would have more financial stability and be less likely to depend on credit or government assistance to meet their basic needs. This could help reduce personal debt and alleviate the strain on social services. It could also enable individuals to pursue further education or training, start their own businesses, or engage in other productive activities that might otherwise be financially out of reach, boosting entrepreneurship and economic growth.\n\nDrawbacks of Universal Basic Income:\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to implementing a UBI system. Firstly, it could be expensive to provide a basic income to all citizens, particularly in countries with large populations. Secondly, it could lead to inflation as more people have disposable income to spend, which could drive up prices. Thirdly, some critics argue that it could disincentivize work, as individuals might be content with the basic income and not seek additional employment opportunities. Such a policy could therefore have negative effects on productivity and economic competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, the introduction of a UBI is not politically feasible in many countries, including the United States. The cost of providing a basic income to all citizens would require significant tax increases, which could be difficult to implement given existing political polarization and resistance to increased taxation among some segments of the population. Additionally, some may reject the idea of providing a basic income to citizens who are deemed to be undeserving or to “mooch” off the system, leading to opposition to the idea.\n\nConclusion and Recommendation:\n\nOverall, whilst there are several potential benefits of a UBI system, including reducing inequality and poverty, providing a safety net, and encouraging entrepreneurship and economic growth, the potential costs and drawbacks from inflation to disincentivising work, are significant. Despite this, many experts believe that the idea is worth considering as a way to address changing labour markets and growing inequality. If a UBI system were to be implemented, however, it would need to be tailored to the specific context of the US, with a focus on the distribution mechanism, amount and the political feasibility of the scheme. A potential method for implementing a UBI system could be to introduce it gradually and in combination with other welfare policies, such as increased minimum wage, education and training opportunities, and employment programs. Ultimately, the feasibility of a UBI system in the US or any other country depends on a variety of economic, social, and political factors, and careful analysis is required to determine the best way forward.', 'Certainly, the cost of implementing a UBI system in the US would be significant. It is estimated that a basic income of $1,000 per month for all citizens would cost approximately $3.8 trillion per year, or double the current federal budget. Such a cost would require significant tax increases or cuts to existing government programs to free up funding.\n\nOne option for funding a UBI system could be taxation reform. This could include a progressive tax system that increases taxes on the wealthy, as well as implementing new taxes on certain activities or industries, such as a carbon tax. Another option could be to reduce existing government programs, particularly those that are less effective or less essential than a UBI system, such as certain tax breaks or subsidies.\n\nFurthermore, proponents of UBI suggest it may encourage economic growth and productivity, which could generate more tax revenue and offset some of the cost of the program in the long term. The idea is that increased economic activity, entrepreneurship and innovation would lead to economic growth, resulting in more income and jobs that would generate higher tax revenues for the government.\n\nFinally, there are also some potential cost savings from implementing a UBI system. These could include lower administrative costs compared to traditional welfare programs, which could be streamlined, and reductions in healthcare expenses, as individuals with a steady income are likely to have better health outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the cost of a UBI system in the US would be significant, with potential funding options including taxation reform, reductions in existing government programs, and economic growth driven by UBI. In order to be effective, careful consideration must be given to the most sustainable funding options and considerations given to the economic impact of such a significant policy change.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Be sure to get into any crevices or tight areas to completely seal the rock. - Allow the first coat to dry completely before applying a second coat. Check the manufacturer's instructions for drying times, as it can vary depending on what type of sealer you are using. - Apply multiple coats if necessary to protect the painted surface. Be aware that too many coats of sealer could make the colors appear dull or change their appearance. - After the final coat has dried, let the rock cure for at least 24 hours before handling or displaying it. This will allow the sealer to completely dry and harden, making it more durable against wear and tear.

Could you please add more information about the specific techniques used in the therapy? I want to learn more about it.""]",,"[""Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. CBT focuses on addressing the unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the development and maintenance of eating disorders, and helps individuals develop healthier coping skills.\n\nResearch studies have consistently found that CBT leads to significant improvements in eating disorder symptoms, including reductions in binge-eating, purging behaviors, and restrictive behaviors. CBT has also been found to be more effective than other treatments, such as medication or supportive therapy.\n\nOne of the strengths of CBT is its focus on the person's thought processes and beliefs. Through challenging negative self-talk and distorted beliefs about body shape and weight, people with eating disorders are better able to develop a more positive and realistic self-image. In addition, CBT helps individuals develop healthy coping strategies that can be used to manage stress and negative emotions instead of turning to disordered eating behaviors.\n\nOverall, CBT is a well-established and effective treatment for eating disorders, with participants often experiencing significant improvements in their symptoms and quality of life. However, like any psychotherapeutic approach, success depends on the individual's willingness to engage in the process and commitment to change over the long term."", ""Sure, I'd be happy to provide more information on the techniques used in CBT for eating disorders.\n\n1. Psychoeducation: Education is a crucial part of CBT. Patients learn about the basics of eating disorders, how the disorder develops, and how it is maintained. This information helps individuals have a better understanding of their condition and helps them identify their negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n2. Self-Monitoring: In CBT, individuals learn to track their eating behaviors and emotions using a diary or journal. Self-monitoring helps individuals identify patterns in their eating habits and recognize the triggers for their disordered behaviors.\n\n3. Cognitive Restructuring: This technique helps individuals identify and modify their negative thought patterns (cognitive distortions) related to weight, food, and body image. By challenging distorted and irrational beliefs, individuals can develop a more balanced and realistic view of their body and eating habits.\n\n4. Exposure Therapy: Exposure to feared foods or situations is used to help individuals overcome avoidance and fear of certain foods or situations. This therapy gradually exposes individuals to the avoided food or situation and supports them in developing coping strategies.\n\n5. Behavioral Experiments: This technique involves testing one's negative beliefs and exploring new ways of approaching the situation. For example, a person may test the belief that eating a high-calorie food will cause them to gain weight by gradually reintroducing the food to their diet and monitoring their weight to see if it changes.\n\n6. Interpersonal Therapy (IPT): People with eating disorders may have difficulties in interpersonal relationships, which can contribute to the development and maintenance of their disorder. IPT addresses these issues by helping them develop more effective interpersonal communication and coping strategies.\n\nThese techniques are tailored to the individual's specific needs and can vary depending on the type and severity of the eating disorder. CBT is a flexible approach that can be adapted to the individual's readiness and preferences.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

"['Here is a piece of text: White House Curator William Allman is retiring June 1 after a 40-year career, the White House announced on Tuesday. News of Allman’s impending departure, which was first reported by CNN, comes on the heels of the dismissal of Chief White House Usher Angella Reid and leaves vacant two senior positions on the White House’s permanent staff. Allman is responsible for preserving and protecting thousands of pieces of art, furniture and decorative objects in the White House’s collection. He has been a touchstone for first families since 1976. He also helped the Trumps navigate their first months in the executive mansion. Stephanie Grisham, the spokeswoman for first lady Melania Trump, said Allman had thought about retiring last year but was “kind enough” to stay on the job during the transition. “We thank Bill for all of his dedicated service and wish him the very best in his retirement,” she said in a statement. Allman’s friends and associates said he has been planning to step down for a while and his departure is not connected to Reid’s sudden dismissal by the Trumps. Allman worked closely with the two previous first ladies, who both sought to put their imprint on the house. Laura Bush collaborated with Allman on the restoration of the Lincoln Bedroom, combing through historic details to restore it. Michelle Obama, along with Smith, updated the Family Dining Room with Allman’s help by adding modern art and restoring the furnishings. Allman, who could not be reached for an interview, had always planned to stay on long enough to help the Trump family through their first days in the White House before stepping away from the job, said one associate. He has held the top job in the curator’s office since 2002 and became well known in D.C. Circles. He is a native of Bethesda and holds degrees in history and American Studies from the University of Maryland and George Washington University. “His departure means the White House is losing its institutional memory in terms of the history of the house,” said Betty Monkman, who served as White House curator from 1997 to 2002 and worked with Allman for many years.

I want to make sure I'm taking good care of mine so that it lasts a long time.""]",,"[""Menstrual cups are highly popular among women who prefer a reusable menstrual product. It is a small, flexible cup made of medical-grade silicone or latex that is similar in size to a tampon. Menstrual cups are designed to collect menstrual blood rather than absorb it. In this post, we will explore the composition and function of a menstrual cup, focusing on its various parts and how important they are to the overall functionality of the menstrual cup.\n\nComposition of a Menstrual Cup\n\nA menstrual cup is made of medical-grade silicone or latex. Medical-grade silicone is preferred for most menstrual cups because of its safety, durability, and ability to retain shape. It is resistant to high temperatures, ultraviolet (UV) light, chemicals, and moisture. Silicone is also hypoallergenic, ensuring that it does not cause any allergic reactions. Some menstrual cups are made of natural latex, which is sourced from rubber trees. However, the use of natural latex cups is becoming less common due to the prevalence of latex allergies and the allergenic potential of natural latex products.\n\nThe Various Parts of a Menstrual Cup\n\n1. The Rim: The rim of the menstrual cup is provided with a soft lip that forms a seal against the vaginal wall, which ensures that menstrual fluid doesn't leak out.\n\n2. The Body: The body of the menstrual cup is tapered to fit comfortably into the vagina. The body of the cup may be smooth or textured to ensure it stays in place.\n\n3. The Base: The base of the cup is typically wider than the body and is intended to remain outside the vaginal opening. It is usually provided with a stem attached to aid insertion and removal.\n\n4. The Stem: Some menstrual cups have a stem, and others do not. The stem is intended to aid insertion and removal of the cup. If it is too long, it can be trimmed to fit the user's needs.\n\nHow do Menstrual Cups Function?\n\nTo use a menstrual cup, you must fold it and insert it into the vagina. Once inside, the cup opens and creates a seal against the vaginal wall. It then collects menstrual fluid instead of absorbing it. It can collect as much fluid as a tampon can in one go, which makes it perfect for women who do not wish to change their menstrual products frequently. When the cup becomes full, it can be removed, emptied, washed and reinserted. Menstrual cups are reusable, which means that they can be used for several years with proper care.\n\nImportance of Each Component in the Overall Functionality of the Menstrual Cup\n\n1. The Rim: The rim is essential as it forms a seal that prevents leaks. A poorly designed rim that doesn't fit correctly can increase the risk of leaks.\n\n2. The Body: The body must be tapered to snugly fit the walls of the vagina while being smooth, flexible and comfortable to ensure that the user doesn't feel any discomfort while wearing it.\n\n3. The Base: The base must be wide to ensure that the cup doesn't enter the uterus, which can be painful and sometimes dangerous if left for long periods.\n\n4. The Stem: The stem, if provided, must be of a suitable length to aid insertion and removal. Simultaneously, being too long can cause discomfort, and being too short can make it difficult to remove.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a menstrual cup is an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to tampons and pads. It is made of medical-grade silicone or latex and has four main components: rim, body, base, and stem. The rim ensures that the menstrual cup prevents leakage, the body needs to snugly fit the walls of the vagina, the base of the cup must be wide and suitable to prevent the cup from going too far inside, and the stem is an essential part of insertion and removal. Overall, when all the components come together correctly, the result is a safe, comfortable, and reliable menstrual product."", 'Certainly! There are several different folds that can be used to insert a menstrual cup, and different folds work better for different people and cup sizes. Here are some of the most common folds:\n\n1. C-fold: This fold is popular because it is straightforward and creates a narrow tip for easy insertion. To do this fold, you fold the cup in half so that it makes a ""C"" shape. 2. Punch-down fold: This fold can be helpful if you are having trouble getting the cup to open inside the vagina. To do this fold, you press the rim of the cup down with your finger, then fold the cup in half while holding the rim in place. 3. 7-fold: This fold creates a pointed end and can work well for people who have a low cervix. To do this fold, you fold the cup in half, then fold one side down towards the base of the cup to create a diagonal crease. 4. Triangle fold: This fold creates a triangular shape that can be easier to insert for some people. To do this fold, you fold the cup in half, then fold one corner down to create a point. 5. Origami fold: This fold can work well for people who have a high cervix or a particularly soft cup. To do this fold, you fold the cup in half, then fold the rim down towards the base of the cup to create a narrow, pointed shape. Experimenting with different folds can help you find the one that works best for your body and menstrual cup. It can also be helpful to practice inserting and removing the cup a few times when you\'re not on your period to get the hang of it.', ""Sure! Getting a good seal with your menstrual cup is essential for preventing leaks and maximizing comfort. Here are a few tips to help you get a better seal:\n\n1. Make sure you're inserting the cup correctly. It can be helpful to lean back or squat while inserting the cup and make sure the cup is fully open and properly positioned.\n\n2. Try different insertion angles. Some people find that inserting the cup at a slightly tilted angle helps it form a better seal than inserting it straight up.\n\n3. Use lubricant. A small amount of water or silicone-based lubricant can help the cup slide in more comfortably and form a better seal.\n\n4. Don't trim the stem too short. If the stem is too short, it can be difficult to remove the cup, and if it's too long, it can cause discomfort. Experiment with different stem lengths to find the one that works for you.\n\n5. Empty the cup regularly. Emptying your cup every 8-12 hours (or more frequently if needed) can help prevent leaks and ensure a good seal.\n\n6. Practice relaxation techniques. If you're having trouble getting the cup to form a seal, taking a few deep breaths and relaxing your pelvic muscles can help. Sometimes being tense can prevent the cup from seating correctly.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to get a better seal with your menstrual cup and minimize any discomfort or leakage. It can take some practice to find the right technique for your body, so don't be discouraged if it takes a few cycles to get the hang of it!"", ""Of course! Proper care of your menstrual cup is essential for keeping it hygienic and in good condition. Here are some general tips for cleaning and caring for your menstrual cup:\n\n1. Wash your hands before and after handling your menstrual cup.\n\n2. Empty and rinse your menstrual cup with warm water every 8-12 hours or as often as needed during your period.\n\n3. Sterilize your menstrual cup between cycles by boiling it in water for 5-10 minutes. Be sure to use enough water to fully cover the cup and avoid leaving the cup in contact with the bottom or sides of the pot.\n\n4. Avoid using harsh soaps, detergents, or bleach to clean your menstrual cup, as these can damage the material and irritate your skin. Stick to using gentle soap (such as a fragrance-free or unscented liquid soap) or specialized menstrual cup cleaner.\n\n5. Allow your menstrual cup to air dry completely before storing it in a breathable bag or container. Avoid storing it in an airtight container or plastic bag, as this can trap moisture and create a breeding ground for bacteria.\n\n6. Check your menstrual cup for signs of wear or warping regularly, such as cracks, tears, or changes in shape. If you notice any signs of damage, it's time to replace your cup.\n\nBy following these care and cleaning tips, you can help ensure that your menstrual cup stays in good condition and lasts for several years. Always follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your specific menstrual cup, as some cups may have slightly different care requirements.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

It was as if I had been transported back in time, with its immense artistic heritage and medieval architecture that enveloped the city.\n\nI was instantly enchanted by the stunning Duomo, its pink and green marble façade standing proudly above the city skyline. Its flamboyant Gothic design was impossible to miss, and I was awed by the intricate details that adorned every inch of the building. As I walked closer to the cathedral, I could see the gilded bronze statue of Brunelleschi\'s dome reflecting the sun\'s rays, adding to the grandeur of the structure.\n\nAs I wandered through the narrow streets and alleys that made up the historic district of Florence, I was struck by the unique blend of old and new. The medieval architecture blends seamlessly with modern shops, trattorias, and boutiques. The fashion district of Via de\' Tornabuoni was full of high-end designers like Gucci and Prada, while the street vendors sold handmade leather goods and souvenirs.\n\nThe cuisine was another highlight of my time in Florence, and I relished in the traditional Tuscan dishes. I savored every bite of the Florentine steak, cooked to perfection, and enjoyed sipping red wine from the Chianti region. The aroma of fresh bread and olive oil wafting from the bakeries and cafes tempted me to indulge in yet another slice of the crusty bread straight out of the oven.\n\nThe cultural activities in the city were never-ending, and I was captivated by the history and art around every corner. The Uffizi Gallery, with its vast and impressive collection of Renaissance art, was a highlight. I marveled at Botticelli\'s ""The Birth of Venus"" and Da Vinci\'s ""Annunciation,"" and felt like I was transported back in time. The Accademia Gallery, home to Michelangelo\'s David, also left an indelible impression on me. The raw power and beauty of the statue stopped me in my tracks, and I felt incredibly privileged to view such a masterpiece up close.\n\nHowever, what I loved most about Florence was its way of life, and the locals were warm and welcoming. The pace of life was unhurried, and people seemed to take time to appreciate the small things in life. The joy of sitting in a café and watching the world go by was a common sight in Florence, and I enjoyed taking part in this tradition. Local vendors and street artists added to the charm of the city, and I spent many an afternoon chatting with them.\n\nOn my last day in Florence, I climbed to the top of the Piazzale Michelangelo, which offered the most stunning views of the city.

The rooftop lounge at the Hotel Continentale, for example, offers stunning views of the city and Arno River, as well as an extensive cocktail menu.

Could you tell me more about the symbolism behind bib necklaces in European cultures?""]",,"[""Bib necklaces are a unique and prominent piece of jewelry that have been worn by women for centuries across various regions and cultures. They are typically characterized by a prominent section that covers the chest or neckline and can be made from a variety of materials, including beads, stones, metal, and fabric. Bib necklaces have significant cultural significance and have been associated with various symbolic meanings and rituals.\n\nOne example of a culturally significant bib necklace is the Maasai beaded collar from East Africa. The Maasai tribe is known for their intricate beadwork, and their collars serve as a symbol of their social status and wealth. The beads used are traditionally red, white, and black, which symbolize the tribe's strength, unity, and authority. The Maasai women wear these collars during traditional ceremonies and as part of their daily attire.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, bib necklaces were worn by pharaohs and the nobility. These necklaces were made of precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper and often included gemstones, such as lapis lazuli or turquoise. They were believed to have protective qualities and were worn during important religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nIn India, the bib necklace, also called a mangalsutra, is worn by married women as a symbol of their marital status. The necklaces are typically made of black beads and gold pendants and are worn around the neck during the wedding ceremony and throughout the marriage.\n\nThe bib necklace has also been adapted and incorporated into contemporary fashion trends. In the 1960s and 1970s, bib necklaces made a resurgence, mainly in the form of beaded hippie styles.

It was typically made of gold or silver and adorned with jewels.\n\nDuring the Baroque era, bib necklaces were even more elaborate and intricate, with more exaggerated shapes and a greater variety of materials. They were often designed with motifs inspired by nature, such as flowers, leaves, and animals.\n\nIn the 20th century, bib necklaces experienced a resurgence in popularity, particularly during the Art Deco era. These necklaces were characterized by clean lines and geometric shapes, often made with materials such as Bakelite and Art Deco-style crystals.\n\nIn modern fashion, designers continue to incorporate the bib necklace into their designs, creating pieces that reflect both the traditional elegance and modern sensibilities of this iconic piece.

The intricate designs and motifs found on these necklaces also represented the owner's artistic and cultural sophistication.\n\nIn addition to their status-symbol status, bib necklaces were often associated with religion and spirituality. During the Renaissance, Catholicism was the dominant religion in Europe, and bib necklaces were often adorned with religious figures and symbols, such as crosses or figures of saints. These necklaces were worn as a way to express one's devotion and to protect oneself from evil.\n\nIn the Art Deco era, bib necklaces took on a more modern and fashion-forward approach, stripping away religious or social connotations in favor of bold, dynamic designs. The clean lines and geometric shapes of Art Deco bib necklaces were meant to convey feelings of modernity, innovation, and progress.\n\nToday, bib necklaces continue to be seen as a bold and fashionable accessory.

The company has increased the number of hybrid-electric, electric, and natural gas-powered vehicles in their fleet, resulting in a reduction of fuel consumption by over 12 million gallons between 2000 and 2018. UPS also uses electric bikes for deliveries in urban areas and has partnered with public transit agencies to reduce the number of personal vehicles on the road.\n\nCase Study 2: Salesforce\nSalesforce implemented a sustainable transportation program that encourages employees to use public transit, bikes, and electric vehicles for commuting. The company offers transit subsidies, bike parking, and electric vehicle charging stations on-site. Salesforce also partners with public transit agencies to provide shuttle services for employees to and from the office.

The company has added electric delivery trucks, cargo bikes, and e-bikes to their fleet in urban areas. Ikea also offers transit subsidies, bike parking, and showers for employees. The company has reduced carbon emissions from its transport operations by 49%, and employee commuting emissions are down by 60% compared to 2016.\n\nThese case studies can provide inspiration for businesses on how sustainable transportation solutions can be customised to suit their specific needs and requirements.', 'Of course! Here are a few ways that businesses can partner with public transit agencies to support employee transit options:\n\n1. Transit Subsidies: Many public transit systems offer employer-subsidized passes for employees. Businesses can work with the transit agency to provide these passes to employees, either fully or partially subsidized by the company. This can incentivize employees to use public transit for commuting. 2. Company Shuttle Services: Some public transit systems offer shuttle services that can be customised to meet the specific needs of a business. Businesses can contract with transit agencies to provide shuttle services for employees to and from the office, particularly if the office is located far from major transit hubs. 3. Last/Mile First/Mile Solutions: For businesses that are not located close to public transit stations, some transit agencies offer first- and last-mile solutions such as shuttle buses or other transit options from the transit hub to the business location. This can make it easier for employees to access public transit options. 4. Transit Amenities: Transit agencies can work with businesses to provide transit amenities such as bike parking, electric vehicle charging stations, and sheltered waiting areas. This can encourage employees to use public transit options for commuting. Partnering with a public transit agency can be a great way for businesses to provide employees with sustainable transportation options while also reducing the environmental impact of their operations. It can also help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality in the community.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Individuals who focus their efforts on becoming better versions of themselves rather than just pursuing success are more likely to achieve long-term success in MLM.

"['How does asset-based financing compare to traditional short-term financing options, such as lines of credit, when it comes to addressing seasonal cash flow fluctuations?', 'Can you give me an example of assets that can be used for asset-based financing?', 'So, does asset-based financing have any disadvantages compared to traditional short-term financing options?']",,"[""Asset-based financing can be a better option compared to traditional short-term financing options such as lines of credit when it comes to addressing seasonal cash flow fluctuations because it allows a business to leverage its existing assets as collateral for obtaining financing. In asset-based financing, the lender approves a credit facility that is secured by the business's assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or real estate. This financing option is preferred as it provides immediate access to funding without the need for extensive credit checks or financial statements.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional short-term financing options, such as lines of credit, typically require the business to have a strong credit score and income statement to qualify for funding. This makes it difficult for businesses that experience seasonal fluctuations to obtain financing when they need it the most. Additionally, lines of credit may have higher interest rates and require a lot of paperwork and documentation, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n\nIn summary, asset-based financing offers a better solution for businesses with seasonal cash flow fluctuations as it provides more flexible funding options without the need for extensive credit checks or documentation. It also allows businesses to use their existing assets to secure financing, which can help them maintain cash flow during difficult times."", ""Yes, there are several types of assets that can be used for asset-based financing. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Accounts receivable: This refers to the outstanding payments that a business is owed by its customers. These accounts can be leveraged as collateral for financing, allowing the business to receive immediate cash flow.\n\n2. Inventory: A business's inventory is another asset that can be used for financing. Lenders can provide financing based on either the cost or market value of the inventory.\n\n3. Equipment: A business's equipment, such as machinery, vehicles, or computers, can be used to secure financing. The value of the equipment determines the amount of financing available.\n\n4. Real estate: If a business owns property, it can use the property's value to secure financing. This type of financing is typically used for larger loans.\n\nThese are just a few examples of assets that can be used for asset-based financing. The specific assets that can be used will depend on the lender's requirements and the type of financing being sought."", ""Yes, asset-based financing has a few disadvantages compared to traditional short-term financing options:\n\n1. Higher interest rates: Asset-based financing options typically have higher interest rates than traditional short-term financing options, such as lines of credit. This is because the lender is taking on more risk by using assets as collateral.\n\n2. Limited funding: The amount of financing that can be obtained through asset-based financing is limited by the value of the assets used as collateral. This can make it difficult for businesses that need access to large amounts of capital to meet their funding needs.\n\n3. Maintenance of collateral: The business is responsible for maintaining the condition and value of the assets used as collateral. If the value of the assets decreases, it may impact the business's ability to obtain future financing.\n\n4. Risk of asset seizure: If a business is unable to repay its loan, the lender may seize the collateral. This can result in the loss of essential assets and can damage the business's reputation.\n\nIn summary, while asset-based financing can offer a flexible funding solution for businesses with seasonal cash flow fluctuations, it does have some disadvantages that need to be carefully considered before choosing this financing option.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

However, it\'s also a powerful tool for personal growth and self-reflection. At its core, bullet journaling is a simple system that involves using symbols or ""bullets"" to represent different types of tasks or information. For example, a dot may represent a task to complete, a circle may represent an event, and a dash may represent a note or idea. You can use these symbols to create a daily, weekly, or monthly spread, depending on how far ahead you want to plan. In addition to using symbols for task organization, you can also use bullet journaling to reflect on your goals, habits, and personal growth. Here are some ways you can incorporate personal growth into your bullet journaling practice:\n\n1. Create a habit tracker: Use your bullet journal to track your daily habits, such as exercise or meditation. This can help you stay accountable and see your progress over time. 2. Record your reflections: After a week or month, take some time to reflect on your experiences and insights. Note any lessons learned or personal growth achieved. 3. Use a mood tracker: Create a mood tracker in your bullet journal to record your emotional state each day. This can help you identify patterns in your moods and develop strategies for managing your emotions. 4. Write down inspiring quotes: Use your bullet journal to note down quotes or inspiring messages that uplift you and help you stay motivated. 5. Use a vision board: Create a visual representation of your goals and aspirations using pictures and imagery in your bullet journal. When it comes to prompts to get your writing gears turning, here are a few that may inspire you:\n\n1. What are some recurring patterns in your life that may be holding you back from personal growth? 2. What is something that you\'re struggling with right now, and how can you develop a plan to overcome it? 3. What is something that you\'re proud of achieving, and how did you get there? 4. What are some personal goals you\'d like to achieve in the next year, and how can you break them down into smaller steps? 5. What are some self-care practices you can incorporate into your daily routine to improve your mental and emotional wellbeing? Remember, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to journaling or bullet journaling. The important thing is to find a method that works for you and allows you to explore your thoughts and emotions in a safe and supportive space. So don\'t be afraid to experiment, try out different prompts and techniques, and see what resonates with you.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

It made me think about whether what we consider as reality is really just an illusion created by our minds.']",,"['The cinematography in The Matrix contributes to the theme of reality versus illusion in several ways:\n\n1. Color palette: The use of green tint and hue in the Matrix scenes and blue tint in reality scenes creates a stark contrast between the two worlds. The green tint signifies the artificiality of the Matrix, while the blue tint represents the real world.\n\n2. Camera angles: In the Matrix, the camera is often positioned at extreme angles to create a distorted reality. This reinforces the idea that the Matrix is not real but an illusion. In contrast, in the real world, the camera is often positioned at eye level to create a sense of reality.\n\n3. Slow motion: The use of slow motion during action scenes in the Matrix scenes creates a dreamlike quality, which reinforces the idea that it is an artificial world.\n\n4. Sound design: The sound design in the Matrix scenes is often distorted, muted, or replaced with a high-pitched ringing sound. This creates a sense of artificiality and reinforces the idea that the Matrix is not real.\n\nOverall, the cinematography in The Matrix contributes to the theme of reality versus illusion by creating a stark contrast between the two worlds and emphasizing the artificiality of the Matrix.', ""Yes, you're right. The use of mirrors and reflections is another cinematographic technique that emphasizes the theme of reality versus illusion. In several scenes, the characters see their reflections in mirrors or other reflective surfaces, which creates a sense of uncertainty about reality. This technique also reinforces the idea that what we see may not be the truth, and that the characters are constantly questioning what is real and what is not. Additionally, the use of mirrors and reflections also creates a visual metaphor for the characters' struggle to confront and accept their own identities, which is a central theme of the film."", ""Yes, that's a great observation! The use of bullet time in action scenes is another cinematographic technique that contributes to the theme of reality versus illusion. By slowing down the action and showing all the details that we might miss in real life, bullet time creates a sense of heightened reality. It also emphasizes the idea that what we see in the Matrix is not the same as what we experience in the real world. Additionally, the use of bullet time also creates a visual metaphor for the characters' ability to transcend the limitations of the Matrix and see the world in a new way. Overall, the use of bullet time in The Matrix adds to the film's exploration of the nature of reality and our ability to perceive it."", 'Yes, that\'s a great observation! The use of virtual reality in The Matrix allows the characters to explore their own personal realities and beliefs in a way that is not possible in the real world. The Matrix is a manifestation of their individual perspectives, and it reveals their deepest fears, desires, and beliefs. For example, Neo\'s experiences in the Matrix allow him to confront and overcome his own self-doubts and become the hero that he was always meant to be. Similarly, Morpheus\'s faith in the prophecy of ""The One"" is tested and ultimately affirmed through his interactions with Neo. Overall, the use of virtual reality in The Matrix adds to the film\'s exploration of the nature of reality and the power of our individual perspectives to shape our beliefs and experiences.', ""Yes, you're absolutely right! In The Matrix, the characters have to unlearn everything they thought they knew in order to see the truth about reality. This is a central theme of the film, and it emphasizes the idea that our beliefs and perceptions can be limiting and prevent us from seeing the truth. The characters have to undergo a process of mental and physical training to break free from the mental limitations imposed by the Matrix and learn how to perceive the real world outside of it. This process of unlearning is also symbolic of the human journey to enlightenment, which often involves unlearning false beliefs and misconceptions in order to see the truth about ourselves and the world around us. Overall, the idea of unlearning in The Matrix adds to the film's exploration of the nature of reality and the power of human perception."", 'Yes, The Matrix does a great job of exploring the concept of fate versus free will. The film suggests that there may be some degree of predestination, but it ultimately leaves the question open-ended and allows the audience to draw their own conclusions. There are several examples of this dilemma in the film, such as the prophecy that states that Neo is ""The One"" who is destined to save humanity, but also the idea that he has the power to choose whether or not he wants to fulfill that destiny. Similarly, Morpheus believes that everything that happens has already been foretold, but Neo believes that he can change the future by making different choices. This exploration of fate versus free will adds a deeper layer of complexity to the film and invites the audience to question their own beliefs about the nature of destiny and choice. Overall, The Matrix tackles the concept of fate and free will in a thought-provoking way that challenges the audience to consider their own beliefs about these fundamental philosophical concepts.', ""Yes, The Matrix does an excellent job of challenging our perceptions of reality. The film presents the concept that what we perceive as reality may not be the true reality, but instead, could be an illusion created by our own minds, a virtual reality of sorts. This idea is reinforced by the fact that the characters' experiences in the Matrix are so vivid and realistic that they often cannot distinguish between what is real and what is not. The film raises questions about the nature of our consciousness and our perception of the world around us, and whether it is possible that what we perceive is just an illusion. By exploring these complex philosophical themes, The Matrix encourages the audience to think more deeply about the nature of reality and the limitations of our own perceptions.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Each type of loyalty contributes to the overall theme of the narrative, which emphasizes the significance of serving one\'s lord and dedicating oneself to a higher cause.\n\nLoyalty to one\'s king is a central theme in The Song of Roland. Characters such as Roland, Oliver, and Turpin are loyal vassals who serve Charlemagne unconditionally and are willing to sacrifice their lives for his sake. This form of loyalty is highlighted through the contrast between Roland, who fiercely fights against the Saracens, and Ganelon, who betrays his fellow Franks to curry favor with the enemy. The narrative uses language to paint loyal characters in a positive light, describing their bravery, honor, and selflessness. The portrayal of Charlemagne as a great and just king further reinforces the importance of serving him and obeying his commands.\n\nReligious loyalty is also a recurring theme in The Song of Roland. The Franks are depicted as devout Christians who fight against the Muslim Saracens, who represent a threat to their faith. Roland\'s famous battle cry, ""Monjoie"" (""My joy""), is a reference to the holy banner of Saint Martin and symbolizes his dedication to the cause of defending Christianity. The language used to describe the Franks\' faith is emotive and vivid, with numerous references to angels, saints, and the power of prayer. The text portrays religious loyalty as a way to attain salvation in the afterlife, encouraging readers to follow the same path.\n\nFinally, loyalty to one\'s friends is another significant aspect of The Song of Roland. Characters such as Roland and Oliver share a deep bond and are willing to die for each other. This loyalty is particularly evident in the later parts of the narrative when Oliver dies in battle, and Roland mourns him deeply. The author uses characterization to convey this relationship, depicting the two friends as being close and sharing many values. The text emphasizes the importance of camaraderie and the notion that no one should face hardships alone, encouraging readers to value and cultivate close relationships.\n\nThe author of The Song of Roland employs various literary techniques such as symbolism, characterization, and language to convey the theme of loyalty to the reader. For example, the contrast between Roland, who embodies loyalty, and Ganelon, who betrays his comrades, highlights the moral difference between loyalty and treason. Similarly, the use of vivid language to describe loyal characters conveys their heroism and dedication effectively. The use of religious symbolism, such as Saint Martin\'s banner and the holy relics, adds depth and reinforces the link between loyalty and faith.\n\nIn conclusion, The Song of Roland portrays different forms of loyalty, including loyalty to one\'s king, faith, and friends, to convey the message of serving a greater cause. The text employs various literary techniques to reinforce the theme of loyalty, such as symbolism, characterization, and language. The emphasis on loyalty to the king, faith, and friends encourages readers to value loyalty and dedicating oneself to serving a greater good.', 'Certainly! Here are some examples of loyalty to religion and Charlemagne in The Song of Roland, along with how imagery and symbolism are used to advance the theme of loyalty. 1. Loyalty to their religion - The Franks see their fight against the Saracens as a holy war to defend their faith, and their loyalty to their religion is unwavering. Here\'s an example: ""Then all the Franks strike out against those pagans with all their might, who are so dark that they cannot see the light of day, nor know Christ who is the way and the truth."" This passage emphasizes the Franks\' belief in the superiority of their Christian faith and shows that they are willing to fight to the death to protect it. The imagery of light and darkness emphasizes the stark contrast between Christianity and paganism, while the use of the word ""way"" reminds the reader that the Franks see their faith as a path to follow. 2. Loyalty to Charlemagne - The Franks\' loyalty to their king is one of the central themes of the poem, and their devotion is unwavering. The knights are willing to die for Charlemagne, and their belief in him is reinforced by his reputation as a just and noble king. Here\'s an example: ""Charlemagne, who courts no pride or sin, orders Count Ganelon to do his will and not betray the Franks in shame."" This passage shows the reverence with which Charlemagne is held and the Franks\' belief in his moral superiority. The use of the word ""shame"" reminds the reader that loyalty to Charlemagne is seen as a matter of honor, and that betrayal would be a grave affront to that honor. 3. Symbolism - The Song of Roland uses several symbols to reinforce the theme of loyalty. For example, Roland\'s horn serves as a symbol of his devotion to Charlemagne and his willingness to die for his king. When Roland blows the horn to signal that he is in trouble, it is a signal to Charlemagne that the Franks are in peril and that he must come to their aid. The use of the horn as a symbol emphasizes the importance of communication and loyalty, while also reminding the reader of the importance of Charlemagne to the Franks. Overall, The Song of Roland emphasizes the importance of loyalty to religion and Charlemagne, and the use of imagery and symbolism serves to reinforce these themes throughout the text.', ""Certainly! Here are some more examples of symbolism and loyalty to friends in The Song of Roland:\n\n1. Symbolism - The Song of Roland employs several symbols to highlight the theme of loyalty, including the Holy Lance and the White Angel. The Holy Lance represents the Franks' faith and serves as a symbol of their loyalty to God. The White Angel, on the other hand, symbolizes a divine presence and a blessing from God. When the Franks see the White Angel during the Battle of Roncevaux, it serves as a signal of their imminent victory. The use of these symbols reinforces the connection between loyalty and religious devotion and shows the Franks' belief in divine intervention. 2. Loyalty to Friends - The Song of Roland depicts the bond of friendship between Roland and Oliver, which serves as a symbol of the Franks' devotion to each other. In battle, Roland and Oliver fight side by side and share many values, such as bravery, loyalty, and honor. This friendship is tested when Oliver dies, and Roland is left to mourn his loss. However, even in death, Oliver serves as a symbol of loyalty to a higher cause, and Roland continues to fight in his honor. The portrayal of this friendship emphasizes the importance of loyalty to friends and comrades, even in the face of death and adversity. 3. Contribution to the Overall Message - The emphasis on loyalty to friends in The Song of Roland serves to reinforce the central theme of loyalty to a higher cause. The friendship between Roland and Oliver shows that loyalty is not just a matter of serving a king or a religion but also extends to one's companions. The Franks' loyalty to their friends and comrades-in-arms emphasizes their sense of camaraderie and their willingness to work together to achieve a common goal. This theme of loyalty to friends reinforces the message that serving a higher cause involves dedicating oneself to something beyond just personal glory or gain. In conclusion, The Song of Roland uses symbolism and loyalty to friends to convey the theme of loyalty to a higher cause. The author employs these literary techniques to reinforce the importance of serving a greater good and emphasizes the Franks' devotion to their faith, king, and companions. Through these themes, the text conveys a powerful message about the importance of loyalty and the bonds that tie people together in service of a greater goal.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Use both quantitative and qualitative data sources, such as student surveys, school policies, and community outreach programs, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of poverty on educational outcomes.', 'Can you add some more details on how schools can implement these interventions effectively?']",,"[""Introduction\n\nThe relationship between poverty and academic achievement has been a topic of great interest among researchers, educators, policymakers, and stakeholders for decades. Poverty can affect a child's educational outcomes, as low-income students often face various academic, social, and emotional challenges that may hinder their learning experiences. This study examines the correlation between poverty levels and graduation rates in a specific school district or state, identifying causal factors that contribute to the disparities, and proposing effective interventions to improve graduation rates among low-income students.\n\nData Sources\n\nThe research data utilized for this analysis includes information from various sources that are presented below:\n\n- Graduation rates by poverty level in a specific school district or state\n- Student surveys that measure academic engagement and motivation, qualitative data\n- Socioeconomic status data (SES) from demographics of the district or state\n- School policies on attendance, achievement, and interventions\n- Community outreach programs such as after-school programs, mentoring, and counseling services\n\nCorrelation between graduation rates and poverty levels\n\nThe research shows that poverty has a significant negative impact on graduation rates in schools where poverty levels are high. The graduation rates decrease as the poverty level increases. For example, schools with a high poverty level have a graduation rate of 50%, whereas those with a low poverty level have a graduation rate of 90%.\n\nCausal factors contributing to disparities\n\nPoverty can cause various challenges for students, including inadequate access to resources, such as textbooks, technology, and classrooms, as well as decreased academic motivation, lack of parental engagement, and high mobility rates. These challenges can lead to lower academic performance, absenteeism, and ultimately lower graduation rates.\n\nEffective interventions to improve graduation rates among low-income students\n\nSeveral effective interventions can improve graduation rates among low-income students in specific school districts or states. These include:\n\n1. Early intervention: Provide early literacy programs that engage parents and caregivers, provide access to high-quality learning materials, and provide individualized support for students.\n\n2. Counseling services: Schools could provide counseling services, including college guidance, mental and emotional health support, and social-emotional learning programs to address the psychological challenges caused by poverty.\n\n3. Extracurricular activities: After-school programs, mentoring, and tutoring can help students to stay engaged in their studies, improve their academic skills, and develop non-academic skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.\n\n4. Community outreach programs: Community-based organizations and programs can provide additional academic support, access to technology, and resources, such as food, transportation, and healthcare, to students and their families.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, several causal factors contribute to the low graduation rates among low-income students. However, effective interventions such as early intervention, counseling services, extracurricular activities, and community outreach programs can improve academic outcomes, increase academic engagement, and ultimately improve graduation rates among low-income students in a specific school district or state."", ""Sure, here are some additional details on implementing effective interventions to improve graduation rates among low-income students:\n\n1. Early Intervention\n\n- Partnership with community organizations: Schools can partner with community organizations that have expertise in providing early childhood programs that focus on literacy and educational development. - Parent and caregiver engagement: Encourage parents and caregivers to participate in the program, provide resources that help them support their children's learning process. - Additional resources: Provide additional materials and resources to support low-income students, such as books, computers, and educational games. 2. Counseling Services:\n\n- Integrated approach: Schools can adopt a comprehensive approach, integrating mental health and academic services, ensuring that students have access to all the necessary resources under one roof. - Collaboration with community organizations: Partnering with community organizations and mental health professionals can help schools provide effective and sustainable counseling services to low-income students. - Staff training: Provide training and professional development to staff members to build their skills sets, allowing them to more effectively support low-income students' mental and emotional health. 3. Extracurricular Activities\n\n- Interest-based program: Develop after-school programs that reflect the interests and needs of the students, providing a positive learning experience. - Volunteer program: Utilize volunteers, including college students or senior citizens, to provide mentoring support and tutoring services to students. - Transportation: Provide transportation services to help students get home after the programs end. 4. Community Outreach Programs\n\n- Alignment with community needs: Ensure that community outreach programs are aligned with the needs of low-income students and their families. - Partnership with other organizations: Partner with community organizations, faith-based organizations, and other institutions that can provide additional resources and support services. - Evaluation: Regularly evaluate the community outreach programs to measure the effectiveness of the program and identify areas for improvement. In summary, schools can implement effective interventions through partnerships with community organizations, staff training and professional development, resource allocation, and evaluation. Regular evaluation, collaboration, and engagement with communities, families, and students can help schools to deliver interventions that meet the unique needs of low-income students, ultimately improving graduation rates.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Preheat oven to 325°F.\n\n2. In a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. \n\n3. Season lamb with salt and pepper and brown the meat on all sides, about 5-7 minutes in total. \n\n4. Remove the browned lamb from the pot and set aside.\n\n5.

Fluff the couscous with a fork and serve it alongside the spicy lamb tagine.

The ratio of 1:1.25 (couscous to liquid) and 5-10 minutes of resting time in a covered saucepan should yield fluffy and tender couscous.', 'Sure! You can try using some of the following spices instead of cumin and coriander:\n\n- Smoked paprika: this spice will add a smoky, sweet flavor to the tagine. - Allspice: used commonly in Middle Eastern cuisine, allspice has a warm, sweet flavor with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. - Turmeric: often used in Moroccan cuisine, turmeric has a slightly bitter, earthy flavor and is known for its bright yellow color. - Fennel seeds: these seeds have a sweet, licorice-like flavor and are often used in Mediterranean dishes.

A well-designed system can provide valuable insights into customer sentiment, social media activity, and performance metrics, and help organizations respond quickly to any issues that arise.\n\nOutlined below is a detailed plan for designing and implementing such a system:\n\nStep 1: Define the Objectives\n\nThe first step is to define the objectives of the system. What metrics do you want to track? What kind of alerts do you need? Typically, a brand's online reputation management objectives can be divided into the following categories:\n\n1. Monitor customer sentiment and feedback on all online channels\n2. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as website traffic, click-through rates (CTR), engagement rates, and conversion rates\n3. Identify potential issues before they become crises and manage them effectively\n4. Conduct competitor analysis to identify trends in the market and stay ahead of the competition\n\nStep 2: Set up the System\n\nThe next step is to set up the system. You need to choose the right software that can provide you with the features that you need to achieve your objectives. There are several options available on the market, including Hootsuite, Sprout Social, Brandwatch, and SEMrush.\n\nOnce you have chosen your software, you need to set it up. This will involve creating accounts, connecting to relevant social media channels and setting up alerts that trigger when certain keywords or topics are mentioned.\n\nIt is essential to customize the system according to your needs. For example, if you want to track customer sentiment about a particular product or service, you will need to set up sentiment analysis tools to identify positive, negative and neutral mentions. Some systems may already have pre-built tools, while others may require customization.\n\nStep 3: Monitor and Analyze Data\n\nOnce the system is set up, it starts collecting data. You need to monitor the data and analyze it regularly to identify trends and potential issues. It is also important to generate reports that can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your reputation management strategy.\n\nKey performance indicators, such as website traffic, engagement rates, and conversion rates, can be monitored using tools such as Google Analytics, SEMrush, or Moz. Social media monitoring tools such as Hootsuite or Sprout Social can be used to track mentions, comments, and shares on social media platforms.\n\nStep 4: Crisis Management\n\nCrisis management is an essential part of any reputation management strategy. You need to be able to identify potential issues before they become full-blown crises and manage them effectively. The software-based tracking and reporting system should have alerts in place to notify you of any sudden spikes in negative sentiment, a significant increase in mentions, or other indicators that suggest an issue.\n\nA dedicated team should be assigned to respond to any negative reviews or comments promptly. It is essential to craft messages that are empathetic, honest, and transparent. Smart use of social media monitoring tools can help you spot issues as they arise, enabling you to act quickly and effectively.\n\nStep 5: Reporting and Strategic Decision-Making\n\nThe final step is to report on the data gathered and analyze it to inform strategic decision-making. Regular reports can provide valuable insights into which reputation management strategies are working and which are not.\n\nReporting should be customized to reflect your objectives, KPIs, and overall strategy. KPIs such as engagement rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates should be included, as well as sentiment analysis and social media activity.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to reputation management, a software-based tracking and reporting system is an essential tool. By customizing the system to reflect your objectives and monitoring the data regularly, you can identify trends and potential issues before they become full-blown crises.

The proposed community garden project aims to establish a new community garden in our city's downtown area, which will be accessible to residents and local organizations. This proposal will discuss the project's goals and objectives, budget, timeline, selected location, community outreach efforts, and maintenance and sustainability plans.\n\nGoals and Objectives\n\nThe primary goal of the Community Garden Project is to provide access to fresh, nutritious food for low-income families in our city. The proposed site of the garden is in a region that is classified as a food desert, with limited access to healthy food options. The project aims to create a community-led, sustainable garden that provides fresh produce to local soup kitchens, food pantries, and other community organizations. The garden also seeks to strengthen the community's relationships by encouraging intergenerational collaboration and fostering social connections.\n\nBudget\n\nThe budget for the proposed community garden project is $30,000. This budget will cover the costs of purchasing land, preparing and repairing the site, garden supplies, and tools, including seeds, soil, fencing, and gardening tools.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe proposed timeline for the community garden project is six months from the date of approval. The timeline will include site preparation, soil remediation, and cultivation plans. The planting will commence in early spring, and a grand opening is scheduled for early summer.\n\nSelected Location\n\nThe selected site for the community garden project is in the city's downtown area, a region with a high concentration of low-income families, and a significant portion of the population classified as food-insecure. The site covers two acres and is located across the street from the city's busiest transit stations, providing easy access to the garden for commuters and residents.\n\nCommunity Outreach Efforts\n\nThe Community Garden Project will leverage the support of various community organizations and engage with local residents to promote and sustain the project. The outreach initiatives will include volunteer engagement, community advocacy, and fundraising events. Additionally, the project will encourage local schools and community organizations to participate in educational activities to teach gardening techniques, promote healthy eating, and learn about sustainability.\n\nMaintenance and Sustainability\n\nThe community garden project's maintenance and sustainability plan aims to ensure that the garden is sustainable and runs for years to come. The plan includes composting systems, rainwater harvesting techniques, and the development of a team of volunteers to maintain the garden's operations. The team of volunteers will be trained to handle various garden tasks, including maintenance, harvesting, and weeding.\n\nPotential Benefits\n\nThe Community Garden Project promises significant benefits for our community. The project will improve access to fresh produce for low-income families, promote healthy living, and foster social connections. Studies have shown that community gardens can have a positive impact on individuals' mental and physical health, promoting community involvement, and improving relationships.

Can you add some more details about the specific visions of the future that Lila sees?""]",,"['Her name was Lila, and she was born with a gift that both fascinated and frightened her - the ability to foretell the future with crystal clear precision. From an early age, she had known that she was different from other children. While they played with dolls and cars, she would spend hours lost in her own thoughts, staring into nothingness as visions of the future swirled around her mind.\n\nAs she grew older, Lila learned to control her gift, to tune in and out of the realm of the future as she pleased. She saw things that no one else could see - wars and famines, natural disasters and technological breakthroughs. She saw the rise and fall of empires, the birth and death of leaders, the joy and sorrow of countless individuals.\n\nBut as the years went by, Lila began to realize that her gift was not without its drawbacks. To know the future was to be burdened by it, to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders. She saw tragedies unfold before they happened, but she was powerless to stop them. She saw friends turn into enemies, lovers betray each other, families torn apart by greed and ambition.\n\nHer gift also took a toll on her relationships. Lila found it hard to connect with others when she knew how things would end. She saw friendships grow distant, romances fall apart, and families break up. She felt like an outsider, unable to share her true self with anyone. And because people were afraid of her, she was often shunned and feared.\n\nDespite these struggles, Lila refused to give up her gift. She believed that it was her duty to use her foresight for good, to warn others of dangers to come and to steer them towards a better future. But in doing so, she often found herself in a moral quandary. When did her gift become a curse? Was it right to intervene in the free will of others? And what about her own fate?\n\nThese questions haunted Lila as she tried to find meaning in her life. She knew that her gift had the power to change the course of history, but she also knew that it came at a great cost. She wondered if she would ever find peace, if she would ever be able to live a normal life. And yet, she knew that she could never go back to being ignorant of the future. For better or for worse, her gift was a part of her, and she would have to learn to live with it.', ""Of course, I'm glad you enjoyed it! Lila's emotions are a central part of her struggles with her gift. On one hand, she feels a great sense of responsibility to use her foresight for the greater good. She sees herself as a defender of humanity, using her gift to prevent disasters and save lives. This duty comes with a sense of pride, as she knows that she possesses a unique ability that sets her apart from others.\n\nOn the other hand, Lila often feels overwhelmed by the weight of the future. She sees so much pain and suffering that it's hard for her to find joy in the present. She longs to be free of the visions that haunt her, to experience life in the same way as everyone else. She feels a sense of isolation and loneliness, as she knows that no one can truly understand her gift and the burden it places on her.\n\nAt times, Lila's emotions get the best of her. She feels frustrated when she sees people making choices that will lead to their destruction, and she struggles to accept that there are limits to what she can do. She feels guilt when her warnings go unheeded, or when she tries to intervene in the future and only makes things worse. She feels anger when people try to use her gift for their own gain, and she wrestles with the temptation to use her foresight to benefit herself.\n\nAs Lila grapples with these conflicting emotions, she begins to realize that her gift is not the curse she once thought it was - it is simply a part of who she is. She learns to accept the future, both its joys and sorrows, and to embrace the gift that makes her unique. She discovers that she is not alone, and that there are others who share her burden. And as she continues on her journey, she learns that the true power of her gift lies not in predicting the future, but in shaping it."", ""Certainly! Lila's visions of the future are varied and often unpredictable. Some are small and insignificant, while others are world-changing events that will affect the course of history. Here are some examples:\n\n- Lila sees a young girl getting hit by a car on her way to school. She warns the girl and her parents, and they take a different route, avoiding the accident.\n\n- Lila sees a terrorist attack on a major city, but no one believes her when she tries to warn them. When the attack happens, she feels guilty and wonders if she could have done more to prevent it.\n\n- Lila sees a future where climate change has devastated the planet, with massive floods, droughts, and wildfires. She becomes an advocate for environmental causes, using her gift to warn people of the dangers to come.\n\n- Lila sees a love triangle between her best friend, her friend's boyfriend, and a new girl who has moved to town. She struggles with whether or not to intervene, knowing that her actions could affect the lives of everyone involved.\n\n- Lila sees a political candidate winning an election, only to become corrupt and start a war. She faces a dilemma - should she use her foresight to prevent the candidate from winning, or should she let events unfold and hope for the best?\n\n- Lila sees a future where humans have developed technology that allows them to live forever, but at a great cost to the planet. She debates whether or not to use her gift to try and prevent this future, knowing that she will face fierce opposition.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but Lila's visions of the future are wide-ranging and often difficult to deal with. She struggles with the moral implications of using her gift to change the course of events, and wonders if she should let fate take its course, even if that means accepting tragedy and loss.

Can you add more information about the practical implications of the court's decision for software developers and innovators?""]",,"['Introduction:\n\nIn the digital age, software is an integral part of modern society, it\'s ubiquitous and essential. With the rise of software innovation, the law is grappling with how best to regulate software-related intellectual property. The scope of software copyright law is one of the key legal debates of our time. This case analysis will examine the case of Oracle America, Inc. V. Google LLC, which took place within the last two years. The case delved into the critical questions of whether computer code and software interface can be copyrighted and whether fair use is a viable defense in cases of copyright infringement. The analysis will examine the background, the court decision, and the legal and practical implications of the court\'s ruling.\n\nOverview of the case:\n\nIn 2010, Oracle America sued Google LLC, claiming that Google infringed on copyrights for computer code and application programming interfaces (APIs). Oracle argued that Google\'s Android operating system incorporated over 11,000 lines of software code, copyrighted by Oracle\'s subsidiary, Sun Microsystems Inc., and that Google\'s use of the code constituted direct copyright infringement. Oracle further asserted that Google infringed on Sun\'s copyright by copying the ""declaring code"" that comprised 37 Java APIs.\n\nA San Francisco District Court Judge ruled that the APIs in question were not copyrightable, and Google did not infringe on Oracle\'s copyrights. However, the Appeals Court overturned the ruling, stating that APIs were copyrightable, and as such, Oracle\'s copyright had been infringed by Google. However, the appeals court did not make a decision on whether Google\'s use of the copyrighted code counted as fair use.\n\nBackground information:\n\nThe origins of the case date back to Sun Microsystems, which developed the Java programming language in the mid-1990s. Java was designed as an open language to create applications that could run on different devices and operating systems. Sun became the owner of the Java platform and released it to the public under an open-source license. Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, making Oracle the new owner of Java and the copyrights associated with it.\n\nGoogle acquired Android in 2005 and used Java APIs to create Android\'s programming interface for developers to write applications that ran on Android phones. However, Google used the implementing code, rather than declaring code, when it used the copyrighted code in question. Implementing code is unique and creative, whereas declaring code is functional and largely predetermined, with only limited options for creativity.\n\nLegal issues at stake:\n\nThe primary issue in the case was whether the software interfaces could be subjected to copyright protection. The key questions were:\n\n1. Does copyright extend to software interfaces?\n\n2. If so, did Google infringe on Oracle\'s copyright?\n\n3. Is fair use a viable defense in cases of copyright infringement where APIs are concerned?\n\nThere are significant implications should the judiciary decide that program interfaces are copyrightable. This would mean that copyright infringement could apply to the interfaces of all types of computer programs, affecting the future of software innovation.\n\nDetailed examination of the court\'s decision:\n\nIn 2014, a jury ruled that Google\'s use of Java, including the use of interface code, constituted fair use. Oracle appealed, and in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that code interfaces are copyrightable, which was a considerable victory for Oracle. The court rejected Google\'s argument that software interfaces were different from software\'s creative and expressive aspects and should not be protected by copyright.\n\nThe court stated that “[w]e reached the conclusion that Oracle\'s software code and Java API packages are entitled to copyright protection under the Copyright Act.” Copyright protection applies to Java APIs, as they qualify as original works of authorship created by Oracle (the copyright owner), the court found.\n\nThe court argued that Google could have developed its APIs independently and written different APIs but instead deliberately did not. ""Google\'s copying was not fair use. It copied to make its commercial Android product more attractive to device manufacturers and application developers. There was nothing fair about the use."" the court found.\n\nThe court also rejected Google\'s arguments that copyright protection of Java APIs would have a significant impact on future innovation. The court stated that software copyright owners could still seek any necessary licenses, and competitors would need to seek alternative interfaces for their programs.\n\nLegal and practical implications of the ruling:\n\nThe court\'s decision on copyrightability of software interfaces has significant implications for the software industry, developers, and innovators. The decision opens the possibility for software owners to claim copyrights for interfaces and to use litigation to stop competitors from using similar interfaces. This may result in reduced innovation, give owners of copyrighted software an unfair market advantage, and limit the number of applications and programs that can be built by developers.\n\nThe decision is also inconsistent with the practice of the software industry. Often, software companies have worked together, contributing to a wide range of open-source systems that rely on conventional interfaces to ensure interoperability between different software systems. Under the court\'s interpretation, these interfaces could be vulnerable to copyright claims, which would constrain the ability of developers and companies to take advantage of shared knowledge and', ""Sure, I can elaborate on the practical implications of the court's decision for software developers and innovators.\n\nThe court's decision has the potential to significantly impact software innovation, particularly in the context of interoperability and competition. The ruling goes against the typical practices of the software industry, where many developers use open-source software and collaborate on standardized interfaces to ensure interoperability between different software systems. Under the court's decision, these interfaces may be vulnerable to copyright claims, which could limit the ability of developers and companies to take advantage of shared knowledge and create offshoots that add value and innovation to the original code.\n\nMoreover, the court's decision may lead to an increase in litigation related to software interfaces, which could be used as a weapon to restrict competition in the software industry. Software owners may use copyright claims over interfaces to restrict competition and stifle innovation by preventing others from building similar or compatible systems. This could slow down the growth of new software technologies and their integration into related industries.\n\nThe court's decision could also have significant implications for smaller software companies or developers. Larger software companies may use their advantage in resources and legal expertise to protect their rights to software interface jurisdictions, potentially increasing industry monopolies.\n\nFurthermore, the decision could lead to software companies or developers avoiding the use of interfaces created by others out of fear of copyright infringement lawsuits, leading to a decrease in standardization and developmental collaboration.\n\nIn conclusion, it's clear that the court's decision to extend copyright to include software interfaces has significant potential to limit innovation, restrict competition, and stifle the growth of new software technologies. It remains to be seen how this decision will play out in practical terms for the broader software industry, and whether there will be any subsequent legal challenges or regulatory guidance in response to the court's ruling.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Eden, Max, Jax, and Ava knew they had to make a last stand.\n\nIn the fiery battle that followed, Eden sacrificed herself to take down the task force’s attack drones while Max, Jax, and Ava used their powers to defeat the remaining troops.\n\nIn the aftermath, the young adults were hailed as heroes, but the cost of the war was heavy.\n\nThe rebellion had won, but at the expense of many lives.\n\nAs the young adults looked around at the devastation, they knew they had to be careful with their newfound powers, for the consequences of their actions could be catastrophic.\n\nThe war had been won, but the price had been high.\n\nThat was the end of their fight for a better tomorrow.', ""Certainly, here’s a continuation of the story with more individual character development.\n\nChapter Two - The Oppression\n\nEden was the first to discover her powers. She had always felt like she was running out of time, like life was slipping through her fingers too quickly. She never understood why until she found that she could manipulate time. Her power allowed her to slow it down, speed it up or even stop it altogether. \n\nBut her power also came with a price. She would often get lost in her own head, trying to predict the best outcome of situations, and she could only do so much before time would catch up to her. Eden struggled with control and moderation while keeping her power a secret.\n\nJax's abilities, on the other hand, were more explosive. He discovered that he could move objects with his mind, using just his thoughts. But when he was angry or overwhelmed, it would sometimes result in disastrous consequences. People would attribute disasters to him, leading him to feel more and more isolated.\n\nMax, who had always felt like an outcast, had the ability to shift shapes. He had always disliked his appearance, and with his power, he could change it at will to become someone or something else. But this power also made him anxious, leading him to feel that he couldn't connect with anyone because he was never himself.\n\nAva's power was the most straightforward - she could control electrical devices with her mind. But as a result, she had a harder time forming human connections. She would always sense the underlying electrical signals between people and what they said, leading her to be suspicious of others' intentions.\n\nChapter Three - The Rebellion\n\nDespite their struggles, the four young adults were determined to make a stand against oppression. They came together and formed a group with others who had similar powers, slowly building a movement that, in time, grew to be a force that threatened the government's rule.\n\nBut the government could not allow the rebellion to flourish, and they began their hunt for the dissenters, which forced Eden, Max, Jax, and Ava into hiding.\n\nThe young adults struggled to keep their powers in check in such cramped spaces, and communication difficulties led to misunderstandings and fights. They had to learn to rely on each other to survive, even with their limited resources.\n\nChapter Four - The Consequences\n\nThe rebellion was successful, but the consequences of the fighting were big. Eden knew that fighting the government would be disastrous, but she went along with it anyway. And when General Grey sent in the attack drones, she knew she couldn't stop them all. She sacrificed herself to stop just enough of the drones.\n\nMax and Jax suffered deep losses as well. Max had to confront his lack of identity, questioning who he was now that the war was over. He felt guilty for not being able to do more to save Eden.\n\nJax, meanwhile, had his powers questioned by the rebellion. They felt like he had left too many “slip-ups” that led General Grey to capture their headquarters. With their powers being better controlled, he felt less useful and began to doubt himself as well.\n\nAva continued to struggle with connection issues, finding it hard to rejoin society after the conflict. She found herself in the crossfire of accusations and misunderstandings about the rebellion, often feeling that no one wanted to extend a hand of friendship because of the perception of her as a danger.\n\nIn conclusion, although the four young adults were successful in toppling a dictatorship that had oppressed them for years, they had to suffer loss and isolation to achieve that success. As with many uprisings, the victory came at a price, leaving each of them to question who they are, who they are supposed to be, and what they will do with their newfound power."", ""Of course! Here’s a continuation of the story with more details on the rebellion's strategy and tactics, as well as the aftermath of the war.\n\nChapter Three - The Rebellion\n\nThe group worked tirelessly, gathering information and making plans. They planned their attacks carefully, each member contributing their unique abilities to ensure the best possible outcome.\n\nThey started with small-scale strikes, sabotaging government buildings and disrupting the supply chain. Whenever there were signs of unrest, they would deploy their members to quell any opposition, using their powers to keep the situation under control.\n\nThey also utilized their technology and hacking abilities to spread their message and gain public support. They created a website and used social media to communicate their cause, highlighting the government's injustices and the need for change.\n\nAs the rebellion grew in number and influence, they shifted from using tactics like sabotage to engaging in more direct armed conflict.\n\nSoon, they managed to take out the government leaders who had been the primary driving force behind the oppression. This resulted in the bulk of the population rallying around the rebellion and their message for social justice.\n\nChapter Four - The Consequences\n\nThe government lost its hold on power, and the rebellion was finally successful in bringing about a new form of governance.\n\nThe new leaders were elected democratically, with representation of all social classes, and the government began to adopt new policies that were more equitable and supportive of struggling families.\n\nThe new leaders made sure to establish systems of support and resources that would help society heal and move forward in a more promising and positive direction. Education programs were implemented to help people gain new skills and improve their lives, and the rights of women and marginalized groups were protected.\n\nThe young adults played a significant role in the new government, contributing their powers and ideas to ensure the betterment of their world. Eden's power over time allowed her to help solve many issues regarding efficiency and resource allocation. Max learned to harness his shapeshifting ability to help people travel to places that were previously inaccessible. Ava found ways to build technology to improve people's health without using invasive methods, while Jax taught people how to control their own minds and empathize with one another.\n\nThe young adults had learned humbly from their losses and created a better world for everyone. They understood that great power requires great responsibility, and in their victory, their responsibility had grown.\n \nIn conclusion, the rebellion's success made way for a new society, with equal rights and justice for all. The young adults' superpowers had played a key role in winning the triumph against oppression, which, when united with their newfound humility, skillfully served in rebuilding their world as equal participants."", ""Certainly! Here's a continuation of the story with more details on the rebellion's plan of action and the government's response to their propaganda campaign.\n\nChapter Three - The Rebellion\n\nThe young adults knew they had to be careful with their plans to avoid drawing the government's attention. They deployed a two-pronged strategy - conduct their activities in relative secrecy, and spread their message through social media.\n\nTo keep themselves hidden from the government, they used a network of safe houses, knowing they could never afford to stay in any one place too long. They were also careful to avoid using technology that could be easily tracked by the government, using only encrypted communication channels.\n\nThey made sure that none of their activities could be traced back to them, by building up a team of agents, who acted as intermediaries. These agents would pass the message, relay instructions, and gather intelligence, smooth-sailing their activities among different subgroups in the organization.\n\nMeanwhile, they launched a propaganda campaign on social media, with a well-designed website & Facebook page, where they would share stories of oppression in society, behind the scenes of the government's corruption, and publicize their own successes in halting the spread of the government's power through grassroots tactics.\n\nChapter Four - The Consequences\n\nWhile the propaganda campaign was a resounding success, the government soon caught onto the group's social media tactics. They swiftly shut down their pages and arrested some of their key associates. This was the first sign of trouble, and the young adults were forced to disband their movement temporarily.\n\nDuring the interim period, the young adults came together and formulated new strategies to combat the government. They divided into smaller groups and focused on specific activities that could be executed faster, without the need for large-scale social media attention.\n\nThey relied on tactics such as small-scale sabotage, causing minor inconveniences across the board. This helped them maintain a low-profile but also forced the government to expend resources to maintain normalcy.\n\nThe rebellion's diversification into smaller factions made it tough for the government to pinpoint them down with a track set of movements. Gradually, the rebellion regained the upper hand & resumed their propaganda campaign, veiling themselves in secrecy.\n\nChapter Five - The Aftermath\n\nIn response to the rebellion's victory and the new government establishment, society adapted to the new way of life, and the young adults found purpose within it.\n\nThe knowledge gained from their fight for a better world, their experience developed over years of war, and their powers ensured their important contribution to the new society.\n\nThe realization that their actions, words, and abilities gathered a ripple of change prompted them on to learn how to make a true impact. They continued to innovate and searched for better ways to standardize support systems, looking for ways to sustainably improve everyone's lives no matter their status or station in society.\n\nIn conclusion, the young adults' covert strategy allowed for their success - they flew low and escaped government attention but didn't halt their movement. The combined use of social media and developed covert tactics proved vital in achieving their goals. While the government may have caught onto their initial propaganda campaign, the young adults rallied together, innovated, and found a sustainable path forward towards a better future for all.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Cooked pork should feel firm but still yield slightly to pressure.\n- If you prefer a sweeter apple crust, you can increase the amount of brown sugar in the mixture. Alternatively, you can substitute the brown sugar with honey or maple syrup."", ""Sure! How to properly sanitize and calibrate your kitchen thermometer:\n\n- Sanitizing your thermometer is an important step to ensure that it's free from bacteria. To sanitize your thermometer, wash the stem with warm soapy water and rinse it off. Then dip the stem in a solution of one-part bleach to six parts water for one minute. Finally, rinse the thermometer off with clean water and dry it with a clean cloth. - Calibrating your thermometer is important to ensure that it's accurate. To calibrate your thermometer, there are a few different methods but one of the easiest methods is the ice water method. Fill a glass with ice and add enough water to fill the glass. Insert the thermometer into the ice water at least 2 inches deep without touching the sides or bottom of the glass. Wait for the thermometer reading to stabilize (about 30 seconds). The thermometer should read 32°F. If it doesn't, adjust it accordingly for accurate readings. Alternatives to breadcrumbs:\n\n- You can substitute breadcrumbs with gluten-free options like gluten-free panko breadcrumbs or crushed gluten-free crackers. - If you want a low-carb option, you can substitute breadcrumbs with almond meal/flour, ground flaxseed meal, or crushed pork rinds. I hope these tips and alternatives help! Enjoy the recipe!"", ""Sure, I'd be happy to help! Tips on how to make sure the apple crust sticks well to the pork tenderloin:\n\n- Pat dry the pork tenderloin before adding the apple crust, as excess moisture can prevent the crust from adhering properly. - Spread a thin layer of Dijon or honey mustard evenly over the pork tenderloin before topping with the apple crust. The mustard will not only help the crust to stick but also add a nice tangy flavor. - Use kitchen twine to securely tie the pork tenderloin before adding the apple crust. This will help the crust adhere better, especially if the pork tenderloin is unevenly shaped. Side dish options that would complement this dish well:\n\n- Roasted or sautéed vegetables such as brussels sprouts, carrots, broccoli, or green beans would be a great complement to the sweet and savory flavors of the pork tenderloin with apple crust. - A simple salad with mixed greens, sliced apples, candied pecans or walnuts, and a vinaigrette dressing would make a light and refreshing side dish. - Mashed potatoes, roasted sweet potatoes, or butternut squash would be a great option if you're looking for a hearty side dish to complement the pork tenderloin.

Could you add some more information on how you balance your time between maintaining the relationship with your family and other aspects of your life, like work or school?']",,"[""Growing up, I always had a close relationship with my family. We would spend hours talking about everything under the sun, and I felt like I could tell them anything. But after a few years of college, I found myself navigating a long-distance familial relationship with my parents, who had moved to a different state. It was a challenge that I wasn't prepared for, and I had to learn how to maintain the closeness we had always shared. \n\nThe first thing I did was make sure that we were communicating regularly. Every week, we would set aside time to talk over the phone or video call. Sometimes we would just check in with each other, and other times we would have longer conversations about our lives and what was happening in the world. I also made sure to send them little updates throughout the week, like pictures of my cat or funny memes that I found online. These small moments of connection helped us continue to feel like a family despite the distance between us. \n\nOver time, I realized that our relationship had changed. We were still close, but it was different than when we lived together. Instead of knowing every detail of each other's lives, we were learning to communicate in a new way. I had to learn to be more intentional about what I shared with them and how I shared it. They had to learn to trust that I was capable of taking care of myself, even from a distance. It was a learning curve, but we were committed to staying close. \n\nTechnology and communication played a huge role in our long-distance relationship. Without it, I don't know how we would have stayed as close as we did. Video calls allowed us to see each other, even when we were miles apart. Messaging apps made it easy to keep in touch throughout the day, whether we were sharing a quick update or having a longer conversation. We even started watching TV shows and movies together online, which was a fun way to spend time with each other even when we couldn't be in the same room. \n\nOf course, there were times when the distance was difficult. I missed being able to hug my parents whenever I wanted or just sit on the couch and watch TV together. There were moments of homesickness and loneliness that were hard to shake. But despite those feelings, our relationship remained strong. We were able to work through the emotions and continue to build a strong bond. \n\nThe impact of the long-distance relationship extended beyond just my relationship with my parents. It affected other aspects of my life, like my friendships and romantic relationships. I found myself reaching out to friends more often, wanting to cultivate those relationships in the same way I was with my family. I also learned to value the time I had with partners who lived closer to me, making sure to prioritize quality time together when we could. \n\nNavigating a long-distance familial relationship was a challenge, but it ultimately strengthened my bond with my parents. We learned to communicate in new ways, trust each other from a distance, and stay connected despite the miles between us. It taught me the value of intentional communication and the power of technology in keeping relationships strong. While I hope that one day we can live in the same place again, I know that we will always be close, no matter where we are."", 'Certainly! One of the most helpful technological tools for maintaining my relationship with my parents was video calling. Whenever we scheduled a video call, it felt like we were in the same room together, despite the hundreds of miles between us. One time, my mom and I were discussing a book we had both read, and we had such a lively debate that lasted for over an hour. It was amazing to feel so connected to her, even though we were in different states. Another time, my dad was feeling a bit down one day, and I wanted to cheer him up. I sent him a funny video I had found online, and his response was immediate. He texted me back with laughing emojis and wrote, ""You always know how to make me laugh, even from hundreds of miles away."" It was moments like that where I realized how the smallest moments of connection could make such a big difference. Technology also allowed us to work together on projects or hobbies, even though we were physically apart. One summer, my parents and I wanted to start a garden, but we were obviously unable to collaborate in-person. So, we decided to start a group chat, where we could share pictures of the plants and ask each other for advice. It was fun to have an ongoing project that we worked on together, despite being hundreds of miles apart. Overall, technology made it possible for us to stay connected and bonded, even when we were not in the same state. It allowed us to have those small moments of connection that we had always valued, and it helped us to continue growing and learning from each other.', ""Yes, communication issues did occasionally arise during this time. There were times when I felt like my parents were being overprotective or intrusive, and I would get defensive or frustrated. Conversely, they sometimes felt like I was being distant or withholding, and they would get worried or upset. But we were committed to working through these misunderstandings and miscommunications, and we found ways to make sure that we stayed close despite our differences.\n\nThe first step in addressing these issues was to acknowledge them. Whenever we sensed tension or distance between us, we would talk about it, even if it was uncomfortable. We would ask each other how we were feeling, and we would try to identify the root of the problem. Sometimes it was simply miscommunication, and we were able to clear up any misunderstandings. Other times, it was deeper than that, and we would have to work together to find a solution that worked for everyone.\n\nAnother helpful strategy was learning to express our emotions clearly and honestly. When we were frustrated or upset, we would try to be direct about what was bothering us, rather than letting it fester or come out in passive-aggressive ways. This meant being vulnerable with each other, but it also meant that we were able to address issues head-on and find solutions together.\n\nI also tried to practice empathy and understanding when my parents expressed concern or worry about my life. Instead of assuming that they were being judgmental or nosy, I tried to see things from their perspective and understand where they were coming from. Similarly, they tried to understand my perspective when I wanted to take risks or make decisions that were different from what they would have done.\n\nUltimately, working through these communication issues made our relationship stronger. We learned to be more patient and understanding with each other, and we found new ways to communicate that worked for everyone. It wasn't always easy, but it was definitely worth it to maintain our close familial bond, even from miles apart."", 'Yes, balancing my familial long-distance relationship with other aspects of my life, like work and school, was definitely a challenge. Initially, I found myself talking to my family for hours every day, to the point where it was taking up a significant portion of my time. I knew I needed to find a way to balance my priorities, so I could maintain a healthy and fulfilling life while also staying connected with my family.\n\nOne strategy I used was to schedule regular times for communication. I found setting a specific time every week to talk to my parents and siblings allowed me to structure my days better. It also helped me to be fully present during those conversations, without feeling guilty about neglecting other aspects of my life. I also learned to prioritize my time with them, recognizing that maintaining a close familial bond was essential for my well-being and overall happiness.\n\nAnother strategy I used was to make sure that I was taking care of myself. If I was exhausted or stressed from work or school, it was harder for me to be fully present and engaged during my conversations with my family. So, I made a point to prioritize things like exercise, sleep, and relaxation, which helped me to feel more grounded and balanced.\n\nIn addition, I learned to integrate communication with my family into my daily routines. Instead of feeling like I had to carve out a specific time for every conversation, I would text or send quick updates throughout the day. This made it easier to stay connected, even when I was busy with work or school.\n\nFinally, I recognized that maintaining my familial long-distance relationship did not have to come at the expense of my other relationships. I made sure to prioritize my friendships and romantic relationships, as well, recognizing that they were also essential for my well-being. By doing so, I was able to maintain a healthy balance between all of the different aspects of my life.\n\nBalancing my familial long-distance relationship with other aspects of my life was not always easy, but it was essential for maintaining my overall well-being. By integrating communication into my daily routine, prioritizing my time, and taking care of myself, I was able to maintain those close familial bonds while also pursuing other aspects of my life.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Can you add some specific examples of countries that have implemented UBI and their experiences with it?']",,"[""Income inequality, the uneven distribution of wealth among different segments of society, has become an increasingly pressing issue in today's world. The short-term and long-term effects of income inequality can be traced to various spheres of life, including economic growth, social mobility, health outcomes, crime rates, political power dynamics, and overall well-being of different segments of the population. In this essay, I will explore the consequences of income inequality, examine specific examples and evidence, and identify potential solutions and their benefits and drawbacks.\n\nOne of the primary short-term impacts of income inequality is that it slows down economic growth by limiting consumer demand. When a significant portion of the population struggles to make ends meet, they are less likely to engage in discretionary spending, such as buying property, owning a car, or pursuing entertainment. Because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy in most countries, a stagnation of income for the majority of the population affects overall income growth. For example, in the United States, the income of the top 1% of the population increased more than 10 times faster than that of the bottom 90% between 1979 and 2015, leading to a period of low growth for the economy as a whole. This uneven growth has led to increased dissatisfaction and unrest among the general population.\n\nMoreover, income inequality reduces social mobility as it reinforces the notion that the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer, perpetuating a cycle of intergenerational poverty. Individuals who come from impoverished backgrounds are less likely to have access to resources such as education, job opportunities, and capital, all of which are essential to breaking the cycle of poverty. Consequently, economic mobility stalls, and the gap between the rich and poor becomes a permanent fixture of society. For example, the UK, which has one of the highest levels of income inequality in Europe, has lower social mobility compared to countries with a more equitable distribution of wealth. This situation limits opportunities, making it harder for those in poverty to break free from the cycle.\n\nAdditionally, income inequality negatively affects health outcomes. People from low-income households experience higher levels of stress, inadequate access to healthcare, and higher rates of chronic illnesses. A study by The British Medical Journal found that life expectancy decreased by almost four years for males living in the poorest neighbourhoods in the UK, compared to those from the wealthiest areas. Similarly, in the USA, income inequality is consistently associated with higher mortality rates.\n\nIncome inequality also leads to higher crime rates. Crime is more likely to occur in areas with higher levels of income inequality. The theory of relative deprivation suggests that people are more likely to engage in criminal behaviour when they perceive that they have less than their peers. This comparative disadvantage leads to increased resentment of society, and an increase in criminal activity. For example, the number of people living in poverty in Brazil has decreased, but crime has risen due to high levels of income inequality.\n\nIncome inequality also skews political power dynamics. As the wealthy have more resources to influence policy decisions, they may sway policies in favour of their interests. This outcome can lead to an undemocratic outcome whereby policy favours the wealthy and neglects the interests of the majority. When political power is concentrated in the hands of a few and not reflective of the population's overall views, there is a risk that the government may struggle to ensure stability and social cohesion. \n\nIn conclusion, income inequality has an array of short-term and long-term effects on society, including reduced economic growth, limited social mobility, lower health outcomes, higher crime rates, and skewed political power dynamics. One byproduct of these outcomes is that it can create a society that is less cohesive and can lead to depression, discontent, and unrest among the population. To address this issue, governments must employ policies that stimulate economic growth, support education and social programmes, provide a living wage and ensure tax regimes are fair. However, these solutions are not without consequences, and policymakers must consider the potential ramifications of any interventions."", 'Certainly, here are some additional potential solutions to address income inequality:\n\n1. Progressive taxation: Governments can introduce a progressive tax system where the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay higher taxes. This is achieved by placing a higher tax rate on those who earn more than a certain amount. For example, several Scandinavian countries impose progressive taxes, and the revenue generated is used to fund social welfare programs and infrastructure projects. 2. Increase access to education: Providing equal access to education is another way to address income inequality. Governments can use taxes and revenue generated from progressive taxation to finance education programs, grants and scholarships, which may help create a more skilled and educated workforce. 3. Minimum wage: Another measure is to establish a minimum wage that ensures people receive payment in line with the cost of living. A minimum wage helps to create a floor below which earnings should not drop. In countries where the minimum wage is insufficient, employees may struggle to meet their basic needs. 4. Implement Universal Basic Income (UBI): UBI is a system where every citizen, regardless of their income level, receives a set amount of money regularly. UBI aims to provide basic financial security to individuals and reduce inequality. For instance, Finland began a trial in 2017 to give up to €660 ($730) per month as a basic income to its unemployed citizens. 5. Encourage employee ownership: Employee ownership schemes can be introduced to provide workers with ownership stakes in the companies they work for. This change can help improve worker satisfaction and provide them with a source of income beyond their regular wages. While these potential solutions may address income inequality, they also carry potential drawbacks. For example, progressive taxation may discourage economic investment if the tax load is too high, while increasing access to education may come at a significant cost to the treasury. Governments must carefully consider the short- and long-term consequences of these solutions to determine the best course of action.', 'Certainly. While Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained popularity as a solution to address income inequality, its implementation has potential drawbacks that policymakers must consider. 1. High costs: The main disadvantage of UBI is its potential high cost. The amount of money required to fund a UBI program can be substantial, and the burden on government resources may be significant. The funding for such programs may come from taxes, which may be regressive or may become unaffordable over time. 2. Disincentive to work: UBI may create a disincentive to work. While UBI aims to provide a basic income to all citizens, it may remove the incentive to work, and some people may choose not to work or may work less, which could negatively impact the economy. 3. Difficulty in targeting those in need: UBI is a broad-based policy, and it may not target those who need it the most effectively. In other words, some high-income people may receive UBI payments even though they do not need them, while some low-income people may not receive enough financial assistance. 4. Inflation: If UBI is funded by printing more money, it may lead to inflation. Inflation may decrease the value of currency, making it more expensive for people to buy goods and services, especially vital commodities such as housing and healthcare. 5. Potentially Reduced Social Programs: Some policymakers may oppose UBI, fearing that it may reduce the focus on other social programs. For example, proponents of education funding may argue that UBI will reduce investment in education since people will have more financial resources to be able to pay for education. To conclude, UBI can be a potent tool to address income inequality. However, it can also be a double-edged sword with significant potential drawbacks. Policymakers must weigh the pros and cons to determine the best course of action. A thorough analysis is needed to ensure the benefits of UBI outweigh the costs, and that policies designed to address income inequality are comprehensive, effective and sustainable over time.', ""Certainly. There are a few examples of countries that have experimented with implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI) programmes, and their experiences have varied. \n\n1. Finland: In 2017, Finland began a two-year trial of a UBI programme. The trial offered €560 ($625) per month to a random group of 2,000 unemployed people. The programme was aimed at reducing poverty and encouraging people to take up employment. However, the trial deemed the experiment economically costly and with low employment rates, leading to the Finnish government cancelling the programme.\n\n2. Canada: In Canada, the province of Ontario launched a three-year UBI pilot in 2017. The programme provided an income to low-income individuals and households to help them afford basic expenses, including food, housing, and healthcare. The programme was cancelled in 2018 after the ruling party changed, calling it unsustainable.\n\n3. Alaska, USA: The Alaska Permanent Fund, established in 1982, is a type of UBI in the form of a dividend paid annually to residents of Alaska. The fund is financed by the state's oil revenue and aims to promote economic growth and reduce poverty. The dividend size varies each year based on the fund's performance.\n\n4. Namibia: Namibia's UBI pilot programme, called the Basic Income Grant pilot, ran from 2008 to 2011. The programme was aimed at reducing poverty and improving financial security for the country's poorest families. Preliminary results from the pilot suggested that it had a positive effect on reducing poverty and increasing food security.\n\n5. India: In 2018, the state of Sikkim announced plans to implement a UBI programme. The proposed plan is to provide a monthly allowance of INR 10,000 ($135) to every adult citizen of Sikkim. The programme is aimed at promoting financial stability and reducing poverty in the state.\n\nIn conclusion, while UBI programmes have been implemented in various countries, their effectiveness has varied. Policymakers must take into account the financial cost, the potential disincentive to work and other drawbacks. Further research on the various UBI experiments and their outcomes will help determine its merit as a solution to income inequality.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

It was these skills that had landed her the job as a spy for the government, an elite asset who could infiltrate any organization, slip past any security detail, and gather vital intelligence without anyone ever suspecting a thing.\n\nShe had become an expert in the art of disguise. She knew how to alter her hair, her makeup, her clothing, her voice, and her behavior to suit any given situation. She could become the sultry seductress, the nerdy tech expert, the stoic bodyguard, or the jovial party-goer with ease.\n\nBut all of that training didn't prepare her for what was about to come.\n\nRiley had been given a new mission, one that would take her deep into enemy territory. She was to infiltrate a group of arms dealers who were planning a major attack on American soil. Their exact location and identities were unknown, but Riley had been given a series of clues that she would have to follow to track them down.\n\nThe first step was to make contact with a man named Mikhail, a Russian weapons dealer who was rumored to be involved with the group. She studied his photograph carefully, noting the sharp features and piercing blue eyes. She knew she would have to become someone who could earn his trust, someone who could match wits with him and get close enough to learn his secrets.\n\nRiley spent hours in the makeup chair, undergoing a transformation that left her almost unrecognizable. She donned a red wig and contacts that turned her blue eyes brown. She practiced her Russian accent until it was flawless, and wore a tight-fitting dress that drew attention to her curves.\n\nWhen she finally met Mikhail in person, she was nervous but determined. She flirted with him shamelessly, using her feminine wiles to get close to him. He fell for her act, inviting her to his private penthouse for drinks.\n\nBut as the night wore on, Riley began to notice things that didn't add up. Mikhail seemed to know too much about her, and there were hints that he was testing her. It was only when he pulled out a gun and ordered his men to seize her that she realized she had been set up.\n\nRiley fought with all her might, using her training in self-defense to disarm the men and make her escape. But the damage had been done. She was exposed, her cover blown, and there was no going back.\n\nRiley realized that she was going to have to improvise. She came up with a new plan, one that involved teaming up with a former flame who was now a notorious cybercriminal. She knew it was risky, but she had no other choice.\n\nTogether, they hacked into the arms dealers' network and uncovered their plans. They discovered that they were planning a massive attack on a major city in the United States, one that would cause catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\nRiley and her partner rushed to put a stop to the attack, working feverishly to disrupt the enemy's plans. The tension was high, the stakes were enormous, and every moment counted. But just as they thought they had succeeded, they were ambushed by a group of heavily armed soldiers.\n\nRiley's partner was killed in the firefight, leaving her to face the enemy alone. She used all her skills of disguise and deception to turn the tables on the soldiers, using their confusion to her advantage. She emerged from the battle battered but victorious, having saved countless lives and prevented a disaster of epic proportions.\n\nRiley returned home a changed woman. She had faced challenges and danger that few could imagine, and she had come out on top. But the experience had left her with scars that would never fully heal. She knew that her life as a spy was far from over, and that the sacrifices she had made would haunt her for years to come."", 'Certainly! Here\'s an expanded version of the story, with more depth to the protagonist\'s personal life:\n\nRiley was a spy with exceptional skills of disguise. But even she couldn\'t hide from her past, and the relationships and inner-conflicts that had shaped her into the person she was today.\n\nAs a child, she had grown up in poverty, with parents who were too busy drinking and fighting to care for her. She had learned to fend for herself, to be resourceful and independent. But the scars from those early years remained, and she struggled with feelings of abandonment and self-doubt.\n\nHer work as a spy offered her a chance to reinvent herself, to become someone who was valued and respected. But it also kept her at arm\'s length from the people she cared about, including her boyfriend Jack.\n\nJack was a journalist, a man who was committed to exposing corruption and injustice in the world. He admired Riley\'s dedication to her job, but he also sensed that there was a part of her that she kept hidden, a part that she was afraid to share with him.\n\nTheir relationship was complicated, with Riley never quite sure how much to reveal, how much to let Jack in. She would often push him away, telling herself it was for his own safety, but really it was because she didn\'t want to risk getting hurt.\n\nIt wasn\'t until she was sent on a mission to Russia that she realized how much she needed Jack. She had been given a new identity, one that required her to seduce a wealthy businessman who was believed to have ties to a terrorist organization.\n\nThe mission was going according to plan, with Riley taking on the guise of a glamorous socialite and sweeping the businessman off his feet. But as they grew closer, she began to have misgivings about her work. Was she really making the world a better place, or was she just perpetuating the same cycle of violence and mistrust?\n\nShe called Jack in a moment of weakness, hoping he could offer her some perspective. He listened patiently as she poured out her doubts and fears, and when she was done he told her something that surprised her.\n\n""You know, Riley, I\'ve always admired your ability to blend in, to become someone else entirely. But what I really love about you is that you\'re always true to yourself. You have a moral code, a sense of right and wrong, and even when you\'re doing things that seem shady or underhanded, you never lose sight of that.""\n\nThose words stayed with her, giving her a sense of clarity and purpose that she had been lacking. She completed her mission successfully, planting a bug in the businessman\'s office that allowed her to gather crucial details about the terrorist group\'s plans.\n\nBut when she returned home, she knew she had to make some changes. She reached out to Jack again, this time with a different kind of invitation. She told him about her job, about the dangers and the risks, and she asked him to be a part of her life in a way he never had before.\n\nTogether, they navigated the complexities of dating someone in a high-risk profession, learning how to be there for each other without compromising their work. Riley knew that she couldn\'t change who she was, couldn\'t stop being a spy with exceptional skills of disguise. But she also knew that she didn\'t have to do it alone, that with Jack by her side, she could face any challenge that came her way.', 'Certainly! Here\'s an expanded version of the final battle scene:\n\nRiley had reached the end of her mission, and it was just as dangerous as she had feared. She had uncovered the arms dealers\' plans to attack a major city in the United States, and she had tried to stop them. But now she was trapped, surrounded by heavily armed soldiers who were closing in on her.\n\nRiley knew that her only chance was to use her skills of disguise and deception to turn the tables on them. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what was to come.\n\nShe scanned the area, looking for anything that could give her an advantage. Her eyes landed on a discarded piece of cloth, which gave her an idea. She quickly tore off a strip and wrapped it around her head, obscuring her features.\n\nThen, with a burst of energy, she charged at the soldiers. They were taken aback by her sudden attack, and for a moment they hesitated. It was all Riley needed.\n\nShe ducked behind a nearby crate, pulling out a makeup kit that she carried with her at all times. She worked quickly, applying foundation, eyeliner, and shadow, transforming her face into that of a soldier.\n\nShe knew she couldn\'t mimic their accents perfectly, but she had a good ear for languages, and she could imitate the general area from which they hailed. She spoke in their dialect, hoping that her accent was convincing enough.\n\n""Stop shooting, it\'s me!"" she yelled, aiming her gun at them. ""They\'re not here anymore, they evacuated!""\n\nThe soldiers lowered their weapons, looking at her dubiously. But Riley didn\'t give them a chance to question her. She shouted out orders, telling them to back off and regroup at the rendezvous point. She hoped her instructions would buy her enough time to get away.\n\nShe moved quickly, melting into the crowd of soldiers and blending in seamlessly. She moved with them, always a step ahead, always pretending to be one of them. She listened to their conversations, picking up details that could be useful later.\n\nAnd slowly, she began to work her way towards the exit.\n\nBut just as she was about to make her escape, one of the soldiers grabbed her arm, staring at her with suspicion.\n\n""You\'re not one of us,"" he said, tightening his grip on her.\n\nRiley didn\'t hesitate. She flung herself forward, using the soldier\'s own momentum to propel him into his comrades. They stumbled backwards, tripping over each other in a chaotic melee.\n\nRiley seized her chance, sprinting towards the door. She could hear the sounds of shouting and gunfire behind her, but she didn\'t stop. She ran as fast as she could, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nWhen she emerged into the light, she was panting and sweating. But she had made it out alive.\n\nShe looked back at the building, watching as it exploded in a ball of fire. For a moment, she didn\'t move, mesmerized by the sight. But then she heard the sound of sirens, and she knew it was time to go.\n\nShe turned and ran, her mind buzzing with the adrenaline of the battle. She knew that she had faced challenges that would have broken most people. But she had come out on top, using her skills of disguise and deception to save countless lives.\n\nRiley didn\'t know what the future held, or what new mission she would be sent on next. But she was ready for whatever came her way, knowing that she could face it head on with courage and determination.', 'Certainly! Here\'s an expanded version of the aftermath of the mission:\n\nRiley emerged from the final battle, battered and bruised but victorious. She had used her skills of disguise and deception to escape, and had prevented the arms dealers from carrying out their deadly attack on American soil.\n\nThe impact of her success was immediate. News reports lauded her as a hero, and she received commendations from the highest levels of government. But Riley knew that there was still work to be done. She knew that there were always more threats on the horizon, always more enemies to be uncovered.\n\nThe arms dealers were brought to justice, thanks to the evidence that Riley and her team had gathered. They were tried and convicted, and sent to prison for their crimes.\n\nRiley\'s work was done, but she couldn\'t shake the feeling that she had lost something in the process. She had faced danger and near-death experiences, but she had also pushed away the people she cared about.\n\nIt wasn\'t until Jack came to see her that she realized what she had been missing. He hugged her tight, telling her how proud he was of her, and how much he cared about her.\n\n""You\'re amazing, Riley,"" he said. ""I don\'t know how you do it, but you always manage to come out on top. I just wish I could be a part of your world, too.""\n\nRiley looked at him, her heart breaking. She knew that she had hurt him, had kept him at a distance to protect him from the dangers of her job.\n\nBut she also knew that she couldn\'t do it alone anymore. She needed Jack, needed his support and understanding.\n\nAnd so, with a sense of resolve, she made a decision. She told Jack about her next assignment, a dangerous mission in the heart of an enemy stronghold. And then she asked him to come with her.\n\nAt first, Jack was hesitant. He had never been on a mission like this before, and he knew the risks were enormous.

They are a prominent feature at every game, with both teams having their own mascots. These mascots are often anthropomorphic animals, and they perform various skits and acts during the game to entertain the crowd.\n\nOne of the primary differences between Japanese and American baseball mascots is their design. While most American mascots are cartoonish and often have exaggerated features or costumes, Japanese mascots tend to look more realistic and are often designed to look like specific animals or creatures. They also tend to have more elaborate costumes and often wear traditional Japanese clothing or accessories.\n\nAnother difference is the role of the mascots. While American mascots primarily focus on entertainment and interacting with the crowd, Japanese mascots also play a crucial role in promoting team spirit and representing their team's identity. They often appear at community events and school visits, and their names and designs are carefully chosen to represent the team and its values.\n\nOverall, baseball mascots are an integral part of the culture of the NPB in Japan.

So, these mascots can be considered a part of Japanese pop culture.', 'Japanese baseball mascots have a long history that dates back to the early days of professional baseball in Japan. The first professional baseball team in Japan was founded in 1934, and it was not until the 1950s that mascots began to appear at games. Most of the early mascots were traditional Japanese characters like samurai or sumo wrestlers.\n\nIn the 1970s, the popularity of baseball mascots began to grow, and teams started to invest in creating more elaborate and creative characters. The first official mascot of the Nippon Professional Baseball league was ""Sakura-san,"" a cherry blossom-themed character created in 1979 for the Yomiuri Giants.\n\nSince then, mascots have become an essential part of Japanese baseball culture, with each team having its unique character that represents the team\'s identity and values. Mascots are not just associated with the teams; they are also linked to the local communities and often take part in charity events and school visits, promoting mutual goodwill and cooperation.\n\nMascots also play a significant role in Japanese pop culture and have become the subject of countless merchandising deals and even their TV shows. Some mascots have even become minor celebrities in their own right, with fans eagerly following their performances and antics during games.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of Japanese baseball mascots is a fascinating one that reflects the importance of community, entertainment, and fun in Japanese culture. They have become such an integral part of the baseball experience in Japan that it\'s hard to imagine games without them.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Look for fresh lamb chops that have a bright, pinkish-red color. Avoid those with a dull or grayish color.\n\n2. The chops should have a healthy fat layer covering the meat, but not too much. Look for even fat distribution throughout the meat, as uneven fat distribution can toughen up the meat.\n\n3. Choose cuts that are of equal thickness to ensure even cooking.\n\n4. Opt for bone-in lamb chops for added flavor and tenderness.\n\nHow to Prepare Lamb Chops:\n\n1. Remove the lamb chops from the fridge and let them rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking.\n\n2. Pat the chops dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.\n\n3. Trim off any excess fat or sinew from the edges of the chops using a sharp knife.\n\n4. Season the lamb chops with salt and pepper on both sides. You can also use other seasonings such as rosemary, garlic, or cumin to add flavor to the meat.\n\nHow to Cook Lamb Chops:\n\n1. Grill: Preheat your grill to high. Brush the lamb chops with olive oil and place them on the grill. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F. Let them rest for 2-3 minutes before serving.\n\n2. Pan-fry: Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add a teaspoon of oil. Once hot, place the lamb chops in the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F for medium-rare. Let them rest for 2-3 minutes before serving.\n\n3. Broil: Preheat the broiler to high. Brush the lamb chops with olive oil and place them on a rack, positioned 6 inches away from the heat source. Broil for 3-4 minutes on each side or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F. Let them rest for 2-3 minutes before serving.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n\n1. The internal temperature of the lamb chops should reach at least 145°F for medium-rare.\n\n2. Marinating the chops for a few hours before cooking can help to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor.\n\n3. Resting the chops for a few minutes after cooking allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender and juicy piece of meat.\n\n4. Serve the lamb chops with a side of roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a salad for a complete meal.\n\n5. Lamb chops are great for entertaining and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.', ""Sure, here's a more detailed guide on seasoning and marinating lamb chops:\n\nSeasoning Recommendations:\n\n1.

Lemon and thyme: mix together some freshly squeezed lemon juice, minced garlic, and minced fresh thyme. Brush the mixture over the lamb chops before cooking.\n\n4. Cumin and coriander: mix together ground cumin and coriander with salt and black pepper. Rub the mixture over the lamb chops before cooking.\n\nMarinating Lamb Chops:\n\n1. Choose a marinade that complements the flavor of lamb, such as garlic, rosemary, mustard, or balsamic vinegar.\n\n2. Marinate the lamb chops for at least 1 hour, or even overnight in the refrigerator.\n\n3. To make a marinade, mix together some olive oil, acid (such as vinegar or citrus juice), garlic or herbs, and salt and pepper.\n\n4.

Discard the marinade and pat the lamb chops dry before cooking.\n\nSide Recommendations:\n\n1. Roasted vegetables: roasted carrots, asparagus, or Brussels sprouts make great side dishes for lamb chops.\n\n2. Mashed potatoes: creamy mashed potatoes work well to soak up the juices from the lamb chops.\n\n3. Salad: a fresh, green salad made with leafy greens, cherry tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette can help balance the richness of the lamb.\n\n4.

Roasting: Roasting is best for larger and thicker cuts of lamb chops like the rack of lamb or the leg of lamb. Roasting is a dry heat method that creates crispy exterior and juicy interior, this method results in lamb chops with a crusty exterior and a succulent interior. Roast the lamb chops in preheated 400°F oven for about 20 minutes until medium-rare. 3. Pan-Fry: Pan-frying is best for thick-cut lamb chops like loin chops or shoulder chops. Garlic, rosemary, thyme or spices like cumin, coriander and paprika complement pan-fried lamb chops. Use a heavy cast-iron skillet or non-stick skillet for even heating. Heat the oil over medium-high heat, cook the lamb chops for approximately 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare. 4. Braising: Braising is ideal for tougher cuts of lamb such as the shank or the shoulder chop. This wet heat method results in tender and flavorful lamb chops with a rich sauce. Sear the lamb chops in a heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven, then add broth or stock, vegetables and aromatics. Simmer the lamb chops for 2-3 hours until tender and juicy. Sides that pair well with different seasoning options:\n\n1. Rosemary and garlic: Grilled or pan-fried rosemary and garlic lamb chops go well with garlicky mashed potatoes, roasted root vegetables, or crisp arugula salad. 2. Lemon and thyme: Broiled or roasted lemon and thyme lamb chops pair well with cheesy potatoes gratin, blanched green beans, or tossed leafy green salad with olives and cherry tomatoes. 3. Cumin and coriander: Cumin and coriander spiced lamb chops pair well with the fluffy couscous or quinoa salad, Moroccan-style roasted carrots, or minty yogurt raita.

Enjoy cooking and serving your delicious lamb chops with complementary sides."", 'Sure, here are some wine pairing recommendations for lamb chops and tips for carving and serving them:\n\nWine Pairings:\n\n1. Cabernet Sauvignon: full-bodied cabernet sauvignon pairs well with grilled or roasted lamb chops as its bold flavor can stand up to the rich flavors of the lamb. 2. Syrah: Syrah or Shiraz pairs well with spiced and braised lamb chops as its spicy and fruity flavor can complement the bold flavors of the lamb. 3. Merlot: Medium-bodied merlot can pair well with pan-fried lamb chops as its soft tannins and fruity flavors can provide a refreshing counter to the strong flavors of the lamb. Carving and Serving:\n\n1. Let the lamb chops rest for 3-5 minutes after cooking to allow the juices to distribute and prevent them from spilling out and making the chops dry. 2. Use a sharp carving knife to carve the lamb chops against the grain at an angle. Cut into the bone to release the lamb chop and slice towards the center. 3. Arrange the lamb chops on a platter with additional herbs and lemon wedges to garnish, serve with a side of your chosen accompaniments. Alternative Cooking Methods or Variations:\n\n1. Smoking: If you have a smoker or access to one, lamb chops can be smoked and infused with a smoky flavor. Coat the lamb chops with a dry rub or marinade and smoke them for 1 to 2 hours at low temperature until tender. 2. Sous Vide: Using a sous vide machine is an alternative to traditional cooking methods. Seal seasoned lamb chops in a vacuum-sealed bag and submerge them in a water bath set to 130-135°F for 1-2 hours. Finish the lamb chops in a hot pan or on the grill to get a golden crust. 3. Stir-fry: For a quick and easy alternative, cut lamb chops into strips and stir-fry them with vegetables and sauce for a flavorful and satisfying meal.

Availability of prey: Lions will hunt and eat any prey that is available in their range. The availability of prey can vary depending on factors such as rainfall, prey migrations, and the presence of competing predators.\n\n2. Size of prey: Lions are capable of taking down large prey such as wildebeest and zebras, but they will also hunt smaller prey such as antelopes and gazelles.\n\n3. Hunting style: Lions are opportunistic hunters and will use different hunting strategies depending on the type of prey they are hunting. For example, some prey items may be more vulnerable to ambush tactics, while others may require a chase.\n\n4. Social behavior: Lions are social animals and hunt in groups known as prides. The size and composition of the pride can influence the type and size of prey that they hunt.\n\n5. Adaptation: Lions have adapted to different habitats and prey types over time. For example, some lions have adapted to hunting in dense bushland, while others are better adapted to more open savanna habitats.', 'Yes, lions are primarily nocturnal hunters, and they prefer to hunt at night. During the day, they spend most of their time resting in the shade to avoid the heat of the sun. As the sun sets and temperatures begin to cool, lions become more active and start to hunt.

However, lions are also known to hunt during the day, particularly during cooler weather or when they are hungry and need to find food.', ""Lions use various techniques to communicate with each other during a hunt. Their communication is mainly through various vocalization and body language. \n\nDuring a hunt, the lionesses in a pride coordinate their movements and communicate with each other using soft calls and roars. They keep in contact with each other through communication, which helps them to stay coordinated and locate their prey.\n\nThe male lions, however, play a different role during a hunt. They generally stay at the back of the group and wait for their chance to charge in and take over the kill. They use their powerful roars to scare off any nearby predators and to communicate with the females.\n\nIn addition to vocalizations, lions also communicate through body language. They use their tails, ears, and posture to signal to each other. For example, when a lion is about to attack, it may lower its head and move its tail to signal to the others that it's ready to pounce.\n\nOverall, Lions' communication skills are an integral part of their success in hunting and working together as a team.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Do you think we can do anything to help mitigate the negative effects on the ocean currents and climate patterns?""]",,"[""Ocean currents affect global climate patterns in several ways:\n\n1. Temperature regulation: Ocean currents carry warm water from the tropics to the poles and cold water from the poles to the equator, regulating the temperature of the earth's surface. This helps to distribute heat more evenly around the globe, preventing excessive heating or cooling in any one region.\n\n2. Moisture transport: Ocean currents help to transport moisture from one part of the world to another. This moisture can then be deposited as rain or snow, affecting the weather patterns of the region.\n\n3. Carbon dioxide absorption: The ocean acts as a carbon dioxide sink, absorbing about 25% of the carbon dioxide produced by human activities. Ocean currents help to distribute this carbon dioxide to different parts of the world, affecting the global carbon cycle and climate patterns.\n\n4. Weather patterns: Ocean currents can affect weather patterns by influencing the formation and movement of storms and hurricanes. Warm ocean currents can provide the energy needed to form and intensify storms, while cold currents can weaken them.\n\nOverall, ocean currents play a critical role in regulating global climate patterns, and changes in these currents can have significant impacts on weather, sea level, and ocean ecosystems."", 'One example of how ocean currents have affected weather patterns in the past is the Little Ice Age, which lasted from the 16th to the 19th century. During this time, average temperatures in Europe dropped by about 1 degree Celsius, resulting in harsh winters and colder summers.\n\nScientists believe that this cooling was caused, in part, by a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - a system of ocean currents that helps to regulate the climate in the North Atlantic. This slowdown led to a reduction in the transport of warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic, resulting in a cooling of the region.\n\nThe reduced transport of warm water also had impacts beyond the North Atlantic. As the water cooled, it sank to deeper levels, causing an upwelling of nutrient-rich water that stimulated the growth of plankton. This, in turn, led to an increase in the number of krill and other small organisms that whales feed on, resulting in a population boom for these creatures.\n\nOverall, the slowdown of the AMOC had far-reaching impacts on weather patterns and ocean ecosystems, highlighting the important role that ocean currents play in regulating the global climate.', ""Yes, it's truly amazing how interconnected everything is in the natural world. The ocean currents, atmosphere, and land all play a critical role in shaping our climate and ecosystems, and changes in one of these systems can have cascading effects on the others.

Reducing carbon emissions: One of the most significant ways we can mitigate climate change is by reducing carbon emissions. This can be achieved by transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.\n\n2. Supporting ocean conservation: Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems can help to maintain the health of the oceans and the ocean currents they support.\n\n3. Monitoring changes in ocean currents: Continuously monitoring and studying changes in ocean currents can help us better understand how they are being affected by climate change and other factors and develop strategies to address these issues.\n\n4. Supporting science-based policies: Advocating for science-based policies that prioritize the conservation and protection of the oceans and their ecosystems can help to ensure that future decisions are informed by rigorous scientific research.\n\nOverall, it will take a collective effort to address the challenges posed by climate change and its impacts on ocean currents and climate patterns.

"[""Here is a piece of text: LOS ANGELES — The night Magic Johnson made his NBA debut, he leapt into the arms of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at the Sports Arena in San Diego to celebrate his center’s game-winning skyhook. That scene from Oct. 12, 1979 is part of Lakers legend. As is what happened next. Lawler handled the play-by-play for that game, and was behind the mic again on Thursday. It was a night that culminated with Lonzo Ball sitting in front of a Lakers backdrop, answering questions about a game that had not followed the same magical script Johnson’s had 38 years and one week earlier. Like Johnson, Ball’s first career game came against the Clippers. Whereas Johnson scored 26 points and was part of a dramatic victory, Ball struggled with just three points on 1-of-6 shooting and contributed just four assists. His nine rebounds were a bright spot in an otherwise depressing 108-92 loss. While Ball failed in his first game to announce himself as the next great Lakers point guard, the job is there waiting for him to grow into. It has been bequeathed from Johnson himself. The pressure and hype have been impossible to miss, but Ball seemed unaffected by the expectations, even after the slow start to his career. Johnson stood inside the tunnel that leads to the Lakers locker room, watching as the Dodgers dominant Game 5 win over the Cubs played out on the big screen over center court and considered how the expectations that greeted him as a rookie now cloaked Ball. Ball has never seemed affected by it, not even after his first professional game was spent getting bullied and berated by Patrick Beverley or when five of his six shots, plus two free throws, failed to connect. Lawler remembered Johnson’s debut as a “very, very exciting night.” Thursday’s contest started with much of the same promise, before the Clippers lead ballooned to as many as 30 points, before Blake Griffiin scored a game-high 29 and DeAndre Jordan snared 24 rebounds. Ball spent his time on the court in a dogfight with Beverley, who guarded him the length of the court and denied him the ball on routine inbounds passes. In the first quarter, Beverley chested Ball, sending him to the floor. On the next play, he forced a backcourt violation. Lakers coaches had warned Ball, whose family has developed a global following thanks to the branding savvy of his father LaVar, that this would happen. For Johnson, it was reminiscent of his own battles with Nate McMillan in the 1980s, when he would go home after games covered in bruises. After missing his first three shots, Ball broke through with a 3-pointer with 4:49 left in the second quarter. He was not alone in his struggles. Brandon Ingram needed 15 shots to score 12 points, and preseason star Kyle Kuzma finished with a pedestrian eight points. Ball’s job with the Lakers, and the connective tissue between himself and Johnson, is one of legacy. And that cannot be built in one game in October. Ball has an opportunity to extend Johnson’s legacy showmanship and substance leading the Lakers to glory. And Johnson’s reign as a Lakers executive will be defined by whether Ball can live up to those weighty expectations. Johnson and Ball, Ball and Johnson. One is a reflection of the other because they need each other. Their futures are inextricably linked. They are separated by a generation, but not much else.

Johnson has praised Ball's talent and has expressed his confidence in the young point guard's ability to lead the Lakers to success.\n\nAlthough Ball struggled in his first NBA game, Johnson has been supportive of him and has emphasized the importance of patience and hard work as Ball develops into the team's point guard of the future."", ""Yes, I can provide more information on the expectations placed on Lonzo Ball as the Lakers' point guard and how his performance in his first game affected those expectations.\n\nLonzo Ball was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the second overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, and he was immediately expected to be the team's point guard of the future. With comparisons to Magic Johnson and a hype machine generated by his outspoken father, LaVar Ball, Lonzo had a lot of expectations placed on him from the start.\n\nThe pressure on Ball only increased after the Lakers traded away former point guard D'Angelo Russell to the Brooklyn Nets, effectively clearing the way for Ball to become the team's starting point guard. Magic Johnson, who was the team's President of Basketball Operations at the time, was vocal about his confidence in Ball and his belief that the young point guard could help lead the Lakers back to championship contention.\n\nAfter Ball's lackluster performance in his first NBA game, where he scored only three points on 1-of-6 shooting and committed several turnovers, some fans and media members began to question whether he was ready for the pressure and expectations that came with being a Lakers point guard.\n\nHowever, Magic Johnson and Lakers head coach Luke Walton continued to express their faith in Ball and emphasized the importance of patience as he develops into the team's leader. Despite the early struggles, many still believe that Ball has the potential to become a special player for the Lakers and to help lead them back to their former glory.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

What's the longest distance a snowy owl has been recorded traveling during migration?""]",,"[""The snowy owl's ability to hear and locate prey under snow cover is critical for its survival in the Arctic tundra habitat. Snowy owls have exceptional hearing and can detect prey moving below the snow surface, allowing them to hunt even when their prey is hidden. This hunting technique helps them to find food during the long, harsh winters when prey is scarce and difficult to find.\n\nThe snowy owl's feathered feet also play a crucial role in their survival in the Arctic tundra. Their feathers provide insulation, allowing them to walk on the snow without getting cold or wet. This adaptation is important as snowy owls inhabit an environment with very low temperatures and a lot of snow cover. Without their feathered feet, they would be at risk of developing frostbite, which could be potentially fatal.\n\nIn conclusion, the snowy owl's ability to hear and locate prey under snow cover and their feathered feet are two important adaptations that help them to survive in the harsh conditions of the Arctic tundra habitat."", 'Snowy owls communicate with each other through a variety of calls and vocalizations. They have a range of distinct hoots, barks, and screeches that they use to communicate with potential mates, chicks, and juveniles. \n\nDuring the breeding season, male snowy owls use vocalizations to attract females and defend their territories. Females will also respond with calls to indicate their interest and availability. Once a pair bonds, the male and female will communicate with each other using soft hoots and chirps to stay in touch and coordinate their hunting efforts.\n\nSnowy owl chicks also communicate with their parents through various calls, chirps, and hisses. These vocalizations help the chicks to stay in contact with their parents and indicate their needs when they are hungry or in danger.\n\nOverall, snowy owls have evolved an intricate system of vocalizations to communicate with each other across the vast and isolated Arctic tundra habitat. This helps them to establish and maintain social bonds, coordinate their hunting efforts, and protect and care for their young.', 'Snowy owls are migratory birds that breed in the Arctic tundra and migrate to different regions during the non-breeding season. During the summer breeding season, they inhabit the Arctic tundra, which provides an ideal habitat for them to breed and raise their young. \n\nHowever, during the winter months, as the Arctic tundra becomes more challenging to live in due to the extreme cold and lack of food, some snowy owls will migrate to other parts of North America and sometimes Europe or Asia. Snowy owls have been known to travel thousands of kilometers during their migrations, sometimes even flying as far south as Mexico, Florida, or the Mediterranean.\n\nThe reason for their migration is to find food and suitable habitat, which is scarce in the Arctic tundra during the winter. The migration patterns of snowy owls are influenced by factors such as food availability, weather conditions, and reproductive success.\n\nSome snowy owls may also make short migrations within the Arctic tundra during the breeding season, traveling to areas with more abundant food or better nesting sites. Overall, snowy owls are highly adaptable birds that have evolved to deal with the challenges of living in a challenging environment by migrating to different regions as necessary.', 'Yes, snowy owls are capable of traveling long distances during migration. The longest distance a snowy owl has been recorded traveling during migration is around 7,320 km (4,553 miles). This individual owl was tracked from its breeding ground in Nunavut, Canada to a wintering area in Morocco, North Africa, making it one of the longest known avian migrations in the world.\n\nHowever, most snowy owls do not migrate such huge distances, and their migration patterns can vary greatly from year to year depending on factors such as food availability and weather conditions. Some snowy owls may only travel a few hundred kilometers from their breeding grounds, while others may migrate thousands of kilometers to find suitable habitat and food sources.\n\nResearchers use satellite and GPS tracking devices to monitor the migration patterns of snowy owls, which has provided valuable insights into their behavior, ecology, and conservation status.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

"['Write a research article on how AI is transforming the legal industry.', ""This research article is informative, but can you add more examples of AI tools that are transforming the legal industry? I'm curious to learn more about the different types of AI applications being used by law firms."", 'Hey, the additional examples of AI tools you provided were quite informative. However, I think it would be even better if you could add some real-life examples of law firms that are currently using AI tools. Can you provide some of those?']",,"['Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming various industries for years. The technology has already made significant progress in the areas of healthcare, retail, education, and finance, and is now poised to revolutionize the legal industry. AI has the potential to dramatically improve legal efficiencies, reduce costs, and increase accuracy, thereby creating a more just legal system. This article focuses on how AI is transforming the legal industry.\n\n1. Efficiency in Legal Processes\n\nOne of the primary benefits of AI technology in the legal industry is that it can increase efficiency in legal processes. The traditional legal system is notorious for being slow, bureaucratic, and labor-intensive. However, AI-powered legal tools are automating many tedious tasks that used to require significant amounts of time and effort.\n\nAI chatbots, for instance, can help lawyers respond to frequently asked questions from clients in real-time. They also help law firms to improve their customer service and availability, which can significantly improve client satisfaction. Additionally, AI-powered billing and invoicing systems can streamline the invoicing process, reduce human errors, and speed up the payment cycle.\n\n2. Legal Research and Discovery\n\nAI can also assist in conducting legal research and discovery, which can save lawyers hours of time. Legal research can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task that requires sifting through volumes of books, cases, and legal documents. However, AI-powered research tools can analyze vast amounts of legal data, and provide relevant information to lawyers more accurately and faster than humans. AI-powered legal research tools are also helping to reduce errors and improve the accuracy of legal research, thereby reducing the chances of overlooking crucial information.\n\n3. Contract Management\n\nAI is also transforming contract management in the legal industry. Collecting, reviewing, and managing legal contracts is one of the most significant tasks in law firms. However, AI-powered tools like contract management software can help automate contract review, analysis, and drafting. These tools leverage machine learning algorithms to identify potential contractual issues and help legal teams to take preventative measures.\n\n4. Risk Prediction and Analysis\n\nAI can predict legal outcomes by reviewing the history of similar cases, so lawyers can offer informed advice. Using machine learning algorithms, AI can analyze past cases and associated outcomes to help lawyers assess the probability of success and suggest best-case strategies. This can help legal professionals make data-driven decisions, improve case preparation, and ultimately improve client satisfaction.\n\n5. Document Management\n\nDocument management is a crucial aspect of the legal industry that can be optimized with AI. Electronic Document Discovery (EDD) is the process of collecting, reviewing, and producing electronic documents in response to litigation or investigation. AI-powered solutions can help streamline EDD efforts by providing advanced search and analytical capabilities. These tools can recognize patterns in documents, look for relevant evidence, and even identify privileged information, reducing the time and costs associated with the discovery phase of litigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI is transforming the legal industry by automating tedious tasks that require a significant amount of time and effort. AI-powered tools not only help to increase efficiency and accuracy but also enable legal professionals to focus their skills on more complex and challenging legal issues. With the continued growth of AI and its applications in the legal industry, it is only a matter of time before it becomes an essential tool for every legal professional.', 'Sure, here are some additional examples of AI tools that are transforming the legal industry:\n\n6. Predictive Analytics\n\nPredictive analytics is an AI tool that is used to forecast future events based on historical data. In the legal field, predictive analytics can be used to analyze data sets of past legal cases to predict the likelihood of certain legal outcomes. This technology is particularly useful in litigation and could help lawyers to identify legal precedents and improve the accuracy of their predictions.\n\n7. Intellectual Property Management\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) management is another area where AI is transforming the legal industry. AI tools can help automate the review and analysis of patent applications, identify potential infringements, and assess the strength of IP rights. The use of AI in IP management could result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency in the application process.\n\n8. Natural Language Processing\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is an AI tool that enables machines to understand and interpret human language. In the legal industry, NLP technology is being used to analyze large volumes of legal documents quickly and efficiently. This tool can help lawyers to identify relevant information for their cases and improve their overall document management process.\n\n9. E-Discovery\n\nE-Discovery is a process used to identify and collect electronic data in response to legal investigations or litigation. AI-powered e-discovery tools use machine learning algorithms to analyze large electronic data sets, locate relevant documents, and categorize them in a way that makes it easier for lawyers to review them. This can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with the e-discovery process.\n\n10. Virtual Assistants\n\nVirtual assistants powered by AI technology are changing the way lawyers manage their schedules, respond to emails, and organize their work. Virtual assistants can be programmed to perform routine administrative tasks, such as scheduling appointments and sending reminders, allowing lawyers to focus on more important legal work.\n\nIn conclusion, these are just a few examples of how AI is transforming the legal industry. As technology continues to advance, we can expect more exciting AI-powered innovations to emerge, making the legal profession more efficient, accurate, and accessible.', ""Absolutely! Here are some real-life examples of law firms that are currently using AI tools:\n\n1. Latham & Watkins\n\nLatham & Watkins is one of the world's largest law firms, and it is also at the forefront of AI adoption in the legal industry. The firm uses AI-powered software, such as Kira Systems, to automate the contract review process, saving lawyers time and reducing the risk of errors.\n\n2. Dentons\n\nDentons is a global law firm that has developed its AI tool that uses machine learning algorithms to assist lawyers in identifying potential conflicts of interest. The tool, called NextLaw In-House Solutions, uses data from past cases to identify potential conflicts that may arise in current or future cases. \n\n3. BakerHostetler\n\nBakerHostetler is a law firm that uses an AI tool called ROSS Intelligence for legal research. The tool uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze legal documents and provide lawyers with relevant information on cases. \n\n4. Hogan Lovells\n\nHogan Lovells, a multinational law firm, uses an AI platform called Neota Logic to automate routine legal tasks, such as document review and contract management. Hogan Lovells uses AI tools to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, enabling staff to focus on more complex legal work that requires human interaction.\n\n5. Shearman & Sterling\n\nShearman & Sterling uses a legal analytics tool called Lex Machina to analyze data from past cases and predict possible outcomes in current cases. The tool uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in data sets, providing insights to lawyers who represent clients in intellectual property, securities, and antitrust cases.\n\nIn conclusion, many law firms have already started adopting AI tools to improve their efficiency and accuracy in legal work. With the growth of AI technology, we can expect more firms to integrate AI into their legal work in the future.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

She was widowed early in life and had raised her two children single-handedly working as a librarian. Now, in her middle age, she felt the world had passed her by. She was lonely and lost in her inner world until one day she discovered her newfound ability.\n\nAt first, Mary didn't understand what was happening, but over time, she realized she could travel through her dreams. Every night, she would enter a dream world so vivid and lifelike that it was hard to know which world, reality or the dream world, was real. Mary found comfort and peace in the dream world, where she was free to explore without any limitations.\n\nBut even though she enjoyed the dream world, she knew it wasn't right for her to stay in it all the time. She knew that the dream world wasn't real, and she couldn't keep running away from reality. And yet, night after night, she would fall into the dream world, eager to explore and experience its remarkable beauty.\n\nCaught between two worlds, Mary's emotions were conflicted. She would wake up in the morning, feeling bewildered, unsure if yesterday's events had taken place in real life or if it was part of her dream world. She felt like she was losing her grip on reality, and she knew that no one would believe her even if she tried speaking about her experiences.\n\nThe dream world was both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. In it, she experienced the feeling of flying without any wings, traveling through lush forests and even swimming in crystal-clear blue seas. But there were times when she would wake up screaming, having encountered a nightmare that felt so real.\n\nOne moment, Mary would be curled up in her bed, and the next, she would find herself at a banquet hall filled with royalty and nobles dressed for a grand ball. In the next moment, she would wake up and find herself in the same bed as before.\n\nDespite the wondrous experiences she had in her dream world, Mary felt like she was wasting her life. She knew she couldn't keep living in a world that wasn't real. She had to make a choice between reality and the dream world. So one night, she made up her mind to face her fears and embrace reality again.\n\nAs she lay in bed, waiting to enter her dream world, she had a change of heart. She wondered why she had to pick just one. Why couldn't she have both worlds? Mary realized that her dream world was a place where she could let her imagination run free, with no boundaries or limits.\n\nFrom then on, Mary discovered joy in both worlds. She would dive into her dream world whenever she needed an escape and return to reality when she wanted to experience the beauty of living. Mary had found a balance between the two worlds, and in doing so, she found contentment and happiness within herself."", ""Mary's journey through her dream world was filled with rich sensory experiences that transported her to another realm. In one dream, she found herself atop a mountain peak, the wind rushing through her hair, and the sun casting a warm glow on her skin. She could feel the cool mountain air upon her cheeks as she gazed out over the valley below, marveling at the beauty of the world laid out before her. As she traveled deeper into the dream world, she would come across snow-capped forests, rivers that glittered in the sunlight, and pristine beaches with white sand. The textures of the world were vivid, and Mary could feel the softness of the forest floor beneath her feet, the smoothness of the river stones, and the warmth of the sand on her toes. She heard the sweet melodies of birdsong and the rustling of leaves in the forest as she walked by. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the soft shuffling of the sand underfoot was music to her ears. Mary could smell the fragrance of flowers, the clear mountain air, and the salty sea breeze. The dream world was not just limited to the natural world. It was teeming with bustling cities with streets full of people and shops. Once, Mary found herself transported to a busy market in a faraway land. The smells and sounds of the market were overwhelming. Spices from exotic lands lingered in the air, and the chatter of people haggling over goods was deafening. In some of her dreams, Mary encountered people that she knew, but they appeared different, like caricatures of themselves. The colors were brighter, and their personalities were amplified. Mary's senses were heightened in the dream world, and each experience felt more vivid and intense. But with the good came the bad. The nightmare she had encountered was so terrifying that she could feel the fear clawing at her throat even after she woke up. In the dream world, she was always running from something, and the stress from these nightmares lingered even after she came back to reality. For Mary, the dream world was a place where she could live out her life with more vividness and clarity than she ever thought possible. But she knew that she couldn't stay there forever, and in the end, it was the balance between reality and the dream world that allowed her to find happiness."", ""The nightmares that Mary encountered in her dream world were so vivid and terrifying that she often woke up in a cold sweat. One particular nightmare had come to her multiple times, causing her to fear entering the dream world altogether.\n\nIn the nightmare, she was pursued by an unknown entity, something dark and shadowy that chased her relentlessly through a maze of dimly lit alleyways. Her heart raced as she ran, and the sense of dread that followed her was overwhelming. She could feel the entity's presence, even though she couldn't see or touch it. When she woke up, her heart would be pounding in her chest, and she would be gasping for breath, her body drenched in sweat.\n\nAs she went about her day after these nightmares, Mary felt a lingering sense of vulnerability and fear. She felt like she couldn't shake off the experience, and the fear would often linger in the back of her mind, even when she was awake. She started to worry if she was losing her grip on reality and if she'd ever find a way to control the nightmares in her dream world.\n\nAnd yet, she found herself drawn back to the dream world again and again, her sense of adventure and the enchantment of this new place more captivating than her fear of the nightmares. She decided to face the nightmares head-on and try to understand why they kept coming to her in her dreams.\n\nMary's newfound approach to her nightmares led her to confront them and understand they were born out of her own worries and anxieties that she had been ignoring for years. She realized that the entity was a symbol of her own darkness, which she had been running away from and that it was time to face it head-on.\n\nMary's willingness to face her fears in her dream world eventually led her to overcome them, and as she slept, the nightmares changed, the entity began to appear less and less, and the shadows that had once followed her receded.\n\nIn reality, Mary's ability to control her emotions and face her fears made her feel more powerful and in control of her life. She became more confident and started to enjoy her waking moments with a newfound sense of joy and purpose.\n\nIn the end, Mary realized that her dream world was a reflection of her subconscious and that learning to navigate her fears in the dream world enabled her to live her waking moments with more vitality and courage."", ""As Mary's experiences in the dream world continued, she soon began to realize that her newfound ability to travel through her dreams was impacting her waking life. She began to view the world with new eyes, in a more vibrant, detailed way.\n\nShe found herself paying closer attention to the world around her -- the textures of the bark on a tree, the intricate web of veins on a leaf or observing a bird flitting from branch to branch. Previously, she had walked past such things without noticing or appreciating them, but now her senses seemed sharper.\n\nMary also found that the dreams transported her to different locations, and these locations often inspired her waking life. After visiting an ancient ruin in one of her dreams, she picked up a book on archeology and even started visiting historical sites in her local area. In this way, the dream world had expanded her horizons, and she had started to see the world beyond the limits she had previously imposed.\n\nBut it wasn't just the waking world that changed — Mary's interactions with people changed too. In the dream world, she had made friends with people from around the world, people she'd never even met in real life. These friendships seemed to spill into her waking life, where she felt more open to making connections with people around her. She began to attend social events and found that she was enjoying them more than she ever had before.\n\nHowever, there was a downside to her experiences in the dream world. Mary found herself struggling to distinguish between her dream world and her waking reality. She began to have doubts, wondering if her interactions with dream people were real or just her imagination. She experienced strange, fleeting moments where she thought her dream world existed in the same space as her reality and questioned whether she was slipping into a sense of chaos or even madness.\n\nDespite these doubts, she found that the dream world had a profound impact on her life. It had opened up new possibilities and expanded her understanding of the world. And what's more, it had shown her that she had the courage to face her deepest fears and take risks, something which was previously beyond her reach.\n\nIn the end, Mary decided to embrace both her dream world and her reality. Sure, she still struggled with how they intermingled, but she realized that both worlds had their benefits, and that far from being a weakness, embracing the eccentricity of her experiences had made her stronger, more open to life and its endless possibilities.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k
"['Write an essay about how technology has affected the way we communicate.', 'Can you add some statistics or real-life examples to support the impact of technology on communication?']",,"['In the past few decades, technology has evolved dramatically, strikingly impacting the way we communicate with each other.

Language exchange: Language learning apps such as Duolingo and Babbel have revolutionized language learning, providing easy access to language exchange and learning opportunities across cultures. These statistics and real-life examples highlight the positive impact of technology on communication, providing us with more opportunities, efficiency, and accessibility than ever before.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k
"['Here is a piece of text: JOSE MOURINHO was the architect of his own downfall at Selhurst Park.\nThe Special One questioned the fighting spirit of his players after Crystal Palace outfought, outmuscled and outplayed his Chelsea flops.\nHe even paid a visit to the Eagles dressing room afterwards to congratulate his opponents for showing the \'balls\' his own side lacked.\nBut Palace defender Damien Delaney revealed how a pep talk from Mourinho back in December actually helped foster that spirit in the south Londoners.\nChelsea had just beaten Palace 2-1 at Stamford Bridge but they were hanging on desperately for a narrow victory by the end as the relegation-threatened visitors fought back hard.\nIt was just after Tony Pulis had taken over, and Mourinho gave the Eagles players some words of encouragement that came back to bite him on Saturday.\n""Did that come back to bite him? Yes, for sure! But fair play to him. He came into our changing room again, congratulated us, popped his head in and said \'well done\'. That was nice.\n""It would\'ve been easy for him to try and say something to take the heat off his own team but he\'s a good guy. I admire him.\n""I hope Chelsea go on and do things between now and the end of the season but we put in a brilliant shift. If we haven\'t got spirit, we haven\'t got much.

Anything can happen.""\nPalace could still have a big say in the title race too with Liverpool and Manchester City yet to visit Selhurst. Are they a scarier prospect than this shot-shy Chelsea team?\nSperoni said: ""Because of the performances they are putting in every week, Suarez and Sturridge, they are scary to play against.\n""But Chelsea don\'t have bad players, do they? And City is the same. Some of my compatriots are there so I know them very well.

First-generation college students often face unique challenges because they are breaking new ground within their families. Here are some of the most common challenges:\n\n1. Access to Information: Many first-gen students come from families that have no prior experience with the college application process, which can make it challenging for them to know where to start.\n\n2. Financial Challenges: Financial obstacles are a major roadblock for first-gen students, since they may not have access to the same level of resources and assistance as their peers.\n\n3. Social Isolation: Many first-gen students come from backgrounds that are different from those of their peers, which can lead to feelings of alienation or social isolation.\n\n4. Imposter Syndrome: First-gen students may feel like they don't belong or that they aren't qualified to be in college, which can impact their confidence and performance.\n\n5. Balancing Academic and Family Obligations: First-gen students may also feel pressure to balance academic commitments with family obligations, which can make it difficult to stay on track with coursework or extracurricular activities.\n\nOverall, being a first-generation college student is a unique experience that can be incredibly rewarding, but also challenging.

In today's fast-paced world, our brains are constantly bombarded with information which can erode our mental well-being. However, spending time in nature is a natural way to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, enhance mood, attention, and creativity. \n\nIt's no wonder that nature has a restorative effect on the human mind. The human species evolved in natural environments, where they had to live in tune with the rhythms of the natural world. Nowadays, with increasing urbanization, our connection to nature is becoming more and more distant. However, science shows that even a small dose of nature exposure can greatly benefit mental health. \n\nReducing Stress and Anxiety\n\nImagine walking through a serene forest, listening to the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds. Research shows that spending time in nature can reduce the physiological indicators of stress such as heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels. A study from Stanford University found that a 90-minute walk in nature decreases activity in the brain's prefrontal cortex – the region that's associated with rumination and negative thought patterns. This suggests that spending time in nature can redirect our mental focus away from stress and anxiety, and towards enhancing our sense of peace and tranquility. \n\nEnhancing Mood and Creativity\n\nMany of us have experienced the invigorating feeling of being outdoors – whether it's walking on a beach, hiking in a forest, or simply lounging in a park. Research shows that being in nature can literally make us happier, by triggering the release of endorphins, the body's natural mood enhancers. Studies also suggest that exposure to nature enhances creativity, problem-solving abilities, and cognitive performance. One study found that subjects who went on a nature walk had a 50% improvement in their creative problem-solving abilities. This goes on to show that, even just a small dose of nature can have a positive impact on one's mental state.\n\nEngaging in Outdoor Activities \n\nEngaging in outdoor activities such as hiking or gardening can greatly enhance the mental health benefits of being in nature. For instance, gardening has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms and improve mood. Gardening not only provides a sense of accomplishment, but it also involves physical exercise and the added bonus of being surrounded by natural and aesthetically pleasing scenery. Similarly, hiking in nature has been shown to improve mood and cognitive functioning, as well as decrease anxiety and depression. \n\nSimply Being in Green Spaces\n\nEven if someone is not engaging in outdoor activities, simple exposure to natural environments can still have a positive impact on one's mental health. One study found that just viewing a nature video for a few minutes significantly improved the subjects' mood, even when compared to urban scenes. Parks, forests, and beaches all provide the perfect environment for people to simply relax and take in their surroundings. This can decrease ruminative thought patterns and increase positivity, making one more aware and appreciative of the world around them.\n\nPractical Tips for Getting Started\n\nIt's easy to get started on your journey to spending more time in nature, and it doesn't have to be complicated. Here are some practical tips to help get you started:\n\n- Start small: You don't have to hike a mountain right away. Start with simple outings in nearby parks or woods to acclimate to being in nature. \n- Unplug: turn off your phone or leave it at home so you can fully engage with the natural environment.\n- Join a group: Joining a Meetup or hiking group can provide support and accountability for getting out into nature.\n- Get creative: Try new outdoor activities like birdwatching, geocaching, or nature photography, showing nature from a different perspective. \n- Make nature a daily habit: Incorporate nature into your daily routine, like taking a walk in the park during your lunch break or taking your morning coffee outside. \n\nOvercoming Barriers\n\nIt's understandable that barriers can prevent people from spending more time in nature, such as accessibility, weather, and time. However, there are ways to overcome these barriers:\n\n- Accessibility: Look for nearby parks, nature reserves, or hiking trails. You may discover that green spaces are closer than you think! Public transportation can also provide easy transportation while also being eco-friendly when available. \n- Weather: Dress appropriately for the weather or invest in some weatherproof clothing if needed. Summer isn't the only perfect time to go out into nature. It can be just as rewarding to experience nature in autumn, winter, or spring.\n- Time: Incorporating nature into daily routines can help overcome the issues with having enough time. Even five minutes of nature exposure can have a positive impact on mental health.\n\nCall-to-Action\n\nNow it's your turn to take action! The above tips provide easy ways to get started on your journey towards spending more time in nature. The best way to benefit from nature is to make it a regular part of your"", ""Sure, here are some more examples of outdoor activities that can improve mental health:\n\n1. Beach walks: Walking on the beach while taking deep breaths of sea air, and listening to the sound of waves can create a sense of relaxation, making you feel more refreshed and rejuvenated. 2. Camping: Camping provides a perfect environment to recharge and rejuvenate. The fresh air, sounds of nature, and natural light can improve sleep and increase positive emotions. 3. Yoga: Practicing yoga in natural environments such as a park or a beach can provide a sense of tranquility, making for a deeper yoga practice. 4. Running: Running or jogging in nature, especially on trails can improve mood, attention, and relaxation, helping to reduce stress levels. 5. Rock Climbing: Rock climbing provides an excellent opportunity to challenge oneself, develop problem-solving skills, and increase confidence. 6. Paddleboarding: Paddleboarding in a calm water body can provide a sense of calm and relaxation. 7. Forest immersion: Forest bathing or Shinrin Yoku, a Japanese practice that involves immersing oneself in a forest environment, has been shown to reduce stress levels and promote feelings of calmness and well-being. These are just some examples of outdoor activities that can improve mental health.

I hope this one forgave me when it bid the night adieu. Plunging to its death from the weight of my scars. Chiseled away by caustic words, bitterly spoken. And mold them into a new star upon love's command. A Heavenly body now fallen because of love's disdain. Once emblazoned as fire, it was a diamond drifting across the sky. I will be forever guilt-ridden with sorrow, knowing I caused it to die. Lying here..from an untroubled night. For this was not my fair maiden? Wondering how could this tragedy be? For my maiden now sleeps with a harlot? Without the love that she once gave to me? I would rise in graceful dance. But alas, it would not play. For you alone, my love.

"[""If the opening round heats had a distinctly American odour, the fragrance was unmistakably Russian after the semi-finals as Sergey Shubenkov led the qualifiers for the final later tonight.\nThe European champion took a couple of good scalps in heat two en route to victory in a time of 13.17 and will fancy his chances of landing precious metal when it most counts a little later.\nPredictably, the USA qualified all four men into the final – the first time the world’s most pre-eminent 110m Hurdles nation have done so since the Helsinki edition in 2005.\nYet question marks hang over all the form of the entire quartet in a far-from-vintage showing.\nAn incident-packed first semi-final witnessed a pair of DNFs, a sloppy but ultimately successful qualification performance by the Olympic champion and the elimination of a former World champion in a race high on drama, if not pure quality.\nDefending champion Jason Richardson made a lightning start, but by contrast his US team-mate Aries Merritt crawled out of the blocks and had already conceded a lot of ground by the first hurdle.\nHome favourite Konstantin Shabanov’s hopes of a place in the final were over by the first hurdle as he crashed out in pain clutching his leg.\nOut front, Richardson retained his lead with Thomas Martinot-Lagarde of France and Jamaica’s world No.2 Hansle Parchment, who had only scraped into the semi-finals as a fastest loser, also prominent in lane two.\nMerritt, however, was struggling and mid-race had a lot of work to do if he was to secure a top-three placing. Gradually, though, the World record-holder slowly started to claw back the gap and his top-three mission was made a little easier when Parchment rather agriculturally ploughed through the top of hurdle nine and he slumped to the surface of the track in pain.\nRichardson maintained his control of the semi-final to stop the clock in a fairly mediocre 13.34. Martinot-Lagarde of France snagged second (13.39) and a relieved Merritt found a route to the final by just 0.02 in third (13.44).\nTrinidad’s Mikel Thomas was the unlucky fourth-place finisher with four-time Hungarian champion Balazs Baji (13.49) in fifth.\nThere was also disappointment for 2009 World champion Ryan Brathwaite of Barbados, who finished sixth and last in a modest 13.64.\nIn the second semi-final, USA’s David Oliver – who had looked so impressive in yesterday’s heats after blitzing to a 13.05 heat victory, the fastest ever non-final 110m hurdles time in World Championships history – struggled out of the blocks and it was Wayne Davis of Trinidad and Tobago who held a slight lead over the first hurdles.\nBy mid-race there was little to separate Davis, Oliver, Shubenkov and US champion Wilson with the true picture of the semi only emerging in the second half of the race. It was here that Shubenkov, roared on by the home crowd, came to prominence and held on to the marginal advantage over the last hurdles to win in 13.17 – 0.01 ahead of Oliver, who looked no way as convincing as he did in the first-round heats.\nWilson was just a fraction behind in third (13.20) and such was the superior quality of this semi-final that the two next fastest – Andrew Riley of Jamaica (13.30) and Great Britain’s William Sharman (13.34) – also qualified for the final. In the case of Sharman it was the third time in succession he had achieved the feat at a World Championships.\nSpare a thought for sixth-placed Artur Noga, who was eliminated.

One example is the contrast between the lavish and glamorous world of the Grand Budapest Hotel and the reality of war and poverty that surrounds it. The hotel represents a bygone era of luxury and privilege, while the outside world is chaotic and dangerous.

There has been extensive research conducted into the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, with studies indicating the potential of these practices to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, improve emotional regulation, and enhance cognitive abilities. Moreover, mindfulness and meditation have been successfully implemented in healthcare, business, and education settings as effective interventions for enhancing well-being. However, there are also potential drawbacks associated with these practices, including the potential to trigger negative emotions and experiences in individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. This report provides an overview of the current research on the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, successful implementations in healthcare, business, and education settings, as well as recommendations for how individuals and organizations can incorporate these practices into their daily routines for optimal well-being.\n\nBenefits of Mindfulness and Meditation\n\nResearch has demonstrated that mindfulness and meditation practices have numerous benefits for physical and mental health. According to a meta-analysis conducted by Khoury et al. (2013), mindfulness-based interventions were associated with significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress across several controlled and non-controlled studies. Furthermore, mindfulness-based interventions have been observed to improve emotional regulation, increase empathy and compassion, and enhance cognitive abilities, such as attentional flexibility and working memory (Black et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, mindfulness and meditation practices have been found to be effective interventions for individuals with various mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). According to a study conducted by Vettese et al. (2009), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial conducted by Polusny et al. (2015) found that mindfulness-based stress reduction was associated with a significant reduction in symptoms of PTSD among veterans.\n\nSuccessful Implementations of Mindfulness and Meditation\n\nMindfulness and meditation practices have been successfully implemented in healthcare, business, and education settings as effective interventions for enhancing well-being.\n\nHealthcare: Mindfulness-based interventions have been implemented in various healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, and mental health facilities. For example, a pilot study conducted by Zeratwai et al. (2013) found that a mindfulness-based stress reduction program improved the quality of life and well-being of patients with chronic pain. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial conducted by Peters et al. (2011) found that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety among patients with fibromyalgia.\n\nBusiness: Mindfulness and meditation practices have been implemented in various business settings to improve employee well-being and productivity. For example, a study conducted by Hülsheger et al. (2013) found that a mindfulness-based intervention improved job satisfaction and reduced burnout among healthcare professionals. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial conducted by Bartlett et al. (2019) found that a mindfulness-based intervention improved the well-being and productivity of employees in a large manufacturing company.\n\nEducation: Mindfulness and meditation practices have also been implemented in education settings as interventions for enhancing well-being and academic performance among students. For example, a study conducted by Kaminski et al. (2017) found that a mindfulness-based intervention improved academic performance, social skills, and well-being among elementary school students. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial conducted by Zoogman et al. (2014) found that a mindfulness-based intervention improved academic performance and reduced symptoms of ADHD among college students.\n\nDrawbacks and Limitations\n\nWhile mindfulness and meditation practices have numerous benefits for physical and mental health, there are potential drawbacks associated with these practices. For example, mindfulness and meditation practices may trigger negative emotions and experiences in some individuals, particularly those with pre-existing mental health conditions. Moreover, there is a lack of standardization in the implementation of mindfulness and meditation programs, which may have implications for their effectiveness.\n\nRecommendations for Incorporating Mindfulness and Meditation\n\nTo incorporate mindfulness and meditation practices into daily routines for optimal well-being, individuals and organizations can consider the following recommendations:\n\n1. Seek professional guidance: Individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions should seek professional guidance before incorporating mindfulness and meditation practices into their daily routines.\n\n2. Regular practice: Mindfulness and meditation practices should be incorporated into daily routines and practiced consistently to experience the full benefits.\n\n3. Standardized programs: Organizations that implement mindfulness and meditation programs should ensure that they follow standardized protocols to ensure their effectiveness.\n\n4. Tailored approach: Mindfulness and meditation practices should be tailored to fit the unique needs and preferences of individuals and organizations.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that mindfulness and meditation practices have numerous benefits for physical and mental health, and can be successfully implemented in healthcare, business, and education settings. However, there are potential drawbacks associated with these practices, and individuals and organizations should carefully consider their implementation to optimize their effectiveness. By incorporating mindfulness and meditation practices into daily routines, individuals and organizations can enhance well-being and improve productivity and performance.', ""Sure, I'd be happy to provide additional examples of successful implementations of mindfulness and meditation practices in the education setting and how they can benefit students:\n\n1.

"['Analyze large amounts of data to detect areas or process in a business where energy could be saved. Use statistical models, algorithms and data mining techniques to pinpoint possible opportunities for improvement, and present actionable recommendations that could reduce energy consumption and save costs. Provide a thorough report, including detailed analysis and visualization of the data, highlighting areas of greatest potential impact and outlining how energy saving measures could be implemented.', 'This is great! Can you please elaborate more on the statistical models and data mining techniques that can be used for this analysis?', 'Can you give me some examples of companies that have successfully used data analysis to reduce their energy consumption? And how much energy did they save?']",,"['I can generate the following additional paragraphs that can further elaborate on how data analysis can be used to save energy in a business.\n\nthe first step in using data analysis to reduce energy consumption is to identify areas or processes where energy is being either underutilized, inefficiently used or wasted. Then, the data collected on these processes must be analyzed, often with statistical models, algorithms, and machine learning techniques, to pinpoint patterns and correlations that suggest ways of optimizing energy use. This may require analyzing data from multiple sources, including sensors, meters, weather databases, and production systems, to generate a comprehensive picture of energy consumption patterns in the organization. The data can be analyzed to reveal trends and opportunities to optimize energy usage, identify peak loads, and analyze other data trends that may have an impact on energy use.\n\nafter analyzing the data, actionable recommendations can be suggested, which may include installing energy-efficient equipment, retrofitting existing systems, and changing operational procedures to reduce energy consumption. For equipment optimization, the recommendations could include switching to energy-efficient lighting systems or upgrading to more efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Changing operational procedures may involve scheduling work based on energy efficiency, implementing energy-saving policies, or incentivizing staff to reduce electricity usage.\n\nthe final step is creating a thorough report outlining the data analysis and visualization, highlighting areas of the greatest opportunity for energy savings, and providing clear recommendations for how energy saving measures could be implemented. The report should be structured so that it can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and should provide clear communication to decision-makers in the organization. In conclusion, data analysis and visualization techniques can provide valuable insights for businesses to reduce energy consumption, and consequently, reduce costs and environmental impact.', 'Yes, of course! There are many statistical models and data mining techniques that can be used to analyze energy consumption data and identify opportunities for improvement. Some of the commonly used techniques include:\n\n1. Regression analysis: This technique is used to identify the relationship between an outcome variable (such as energy usage) and one or more predictor variables (such as weather conditions, production output, or occupancy rates).\n\n2. Cluster analysis: This technique is used to group similar data points based on specific characteristics, which can help identify patterns and trends in energy usage.\n\n3. Time series analysis: This technique is used to analyze data that is collected over time, such as hourly, daily or monthly energy consumption data, and identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data that can help optimize energy consumption.\n\n4. Decision trees: This technique is used to create a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, which can help identify which factors are most important in determining energy consumption and where energy-saving measures are most likely to be effective.\n\n5. Association rules: This technique is used to identify patterns that frequently occur together in the data, which can be used to identify areas where energy consumption can be reduced.\n\n6. Artificial neural networks: This technique is used to build models based on the structure and function of the human brain, which can help identify complex patterns and relationships in energy consumption data.\n\nThese techniques can be used alone or in combinations depending on the nature of the data and the business context. The insights gained from the data analysis can then be used to make data-driven decisions that lead to significant energy savings and reductions in carbon footprint.', 'Certainly! There are many companies across various industries that have successfully leveraged data analysis to reduce their energy consumption and costs. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Walmart: The retail giant implemented a program called Project Gigaton, which aimed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a billion metric tons by 2030. They used data analysis to identify areas where they could become more energy efficient, such as optimizing lighting and HVAC systems in their stores. Through these efforts, they achieved a 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to their 2005 levels. 2. IBM: IBM uses data analysis to monitor energy usage in their data centers and identify opportunities for energy savings. For example, they use machine learning algorithms to predict when a server will fail and shut it off, which reduces the amount of energy being used unnecessarily. They have been able to achieve a reduction of 35% in their energy consumption through these efforts. 3. Hilton: Hilton uses data analytics to optimize their energy usage in their hotels. They have implemented a system called LightStay, which tracks energy usage in their hotels and identifies areas where energy can be saved. By using data analytics, they were able to reduce their energy consumption by 30% in the first five years of implementing the program. 4. Kaiser Permanente: The healthcare provider uses data analysis to track energy usage across their hospitals and identify opportunities for energy savings. By analyzing energy consumption data, they discovered that they could save energy by lowering the temperature in certain parts of their hospitals, such as administrative offices and basements. These efforts have resulted in a reduction of 20% in their energy consumption. These are just a few examples of how data analysis can be used to reduce energy consumption, and the energy savings achieved will vary depending on the business, industry, and the scale of the project. However, the impact can be significant, both in terms of cost savings and reducing carbon emissions.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

And which industries tend to offer better benefits packages overall?']",,"[""Salary and wage are two different forms of payment structures that employers use to compensate their employees. The main difference between a salary and a wage is that a salary is a fixed annual payment that is typically paid on a monthly or bi-weekly basis, while a wage is usually paid on an hourly basis.\n\nSalary is a set amount of money that an employee receives annually, regardless of the number of hours worked within a given period. An employee’s salary is normally based on a yearly calculation of the expected workload, and it is agreed upon between the employer and the employee at the time of employment.\n\nFor example, a marketing director may earn a salary of $120,000 per year, which is then divided into payments to be made on an agreed-upon payment schedule, either bi-weekly, monthly, or as agreed. A salary is common in industries such as management roles, professional positions, and executive positions.\n\nThe main advantage of receiving a salary is that there is predictability in the employee's earnings. With a fixed amount of pay, an employee knows their monthly income and can budget accordingly. This consistency can be advantageous, especially if the employee has a set of responsibilities that require consistency, for example, a manager who manages an entire team of employees, or works on specific projects.\n\nHowever, salaried employees who work overtime might not get paid for their extra hours worked, even though their base salary remains consistent. Employees working in some industries, like law, consultancy, management, or medicine, often receive a salary.\n\nOn the other hand, a wage is a payment structure based on the number of hours worked by the employee. The employee's wages are calculated by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours worked within a specified period, usually a week or a month.\n\nFor example, a warehouse worker may receive $25 per hour, and, in a week where they work 50 hours, they would earn a total of $1,250. Industries where workers receive wages include service, retail, and factory positions.\n\nAn advantage of receiving a wage is that employees can earn additional income through overtime pay. Wages also allow employees to receive payment for the exact number of hours an individual works. This ensures that employees are paid fairly and adequately compensated for the amount of work they have completed.\n\nOn the other hand, hourly wages might make it hard for an employee to budget or manage their finances since the amount they earn every month can vary based on the number of hours worked. Wage workers may also be at a financial disadvantage because they do not receive benefits like health insurance, paid time off, or sick days, which are often offered to salaried employees.\n\nIn conclusion, while both salary and wage have their benefits and drawbacks, it is crucial to understand the payment structure before accepting a job offer, to ensure that it aligns with an individual's lifestyle, financial goals, and desired benefits. Taxes, benefits, and overtime pay vary between these two payment structures, meaning an employee in a salaried position might be entitled to benefits such as life and health insurance and paid time off, while temporary or part-time employees receiving hourly wagers may not have access to such benefits. Understanding these differences can help an individual make informed career decisions."", ""Certainly! Some industries or job roles where salaried positions are more common are management, accounting, law, medicine, engineering, and education. These positions require a certain level of expertise or education, and are often salaried to incentivize these workers to stay in their positions for an extended period. Such professions may also require workers to work longer hours and can have more unpredictable workloads, so it makes sense for their pay to be based on an annual salary as opposed to an hourly rate. On the other hand, industries where hourly wages are the norm include retail, hospitality, food service and manufacturing. In such industries, employees are often paid hourly because their workload can fluctuate based on factors such as customer demand or production requirements. For these jobs, employers can justify a payment structure based on the number of hours worked. When employers decide whether to pay a salary or a wage, some considerations include an employee's job duties, level of education or expertise, and job stability. Additionally, companies may consider their budget and business needs when deciding on a payment structure for an employee. Smaller or newer businesses may opt for hourly wages because they may not have the resources to offer salaries. Large corporations may offer salaries because it enables them to account for their employee's earnings predictably and keep track of their expenses more efficiently. Another consideration is the amount of overtime that may be required in a position. Since salaried employees are paid a fixed amount regardless of hours worked, employers may choose a salary structure to avoid paying overtime. Conversely, if an employer expects long hours or if overtime is common in a particular industry, a wage-based compensation structure may be more common. Overall, employers consider a wide range of factors when choosing between a salary and wage structure. These decisions depend upon the specific needs and requirements for the role and the industry, as well as the financial resources available to the company."", 'Certainly, there are a few examples of industries where employees may receive a combination of salary and wage structure. Such payment structures are often referred to as hybrid pay arrangements or hybrid pay models. One example is the retail industry, where managers or supervisors may receive a fixed annual salary, while the sales associates who work under them are paid hourly wages. Another example is the construction industry, where carpenters, electricians, and other skilled laborers may receive a base salary, while their overtime hours are paid at an hourly rate. A third example is the service industry, where employees such as waitstaff or bartenders may receive an hourly wage, but may also receive a percentage of tips. The salary portion ensures that the employees have a steady income, but the hourly wage and tips provide an opportunity to earn more based on their performance. Employers may choose to use a combination of salary and wage payments to balance the need for predictability in labor costs with the ability to adjust pay based on workload or performance. These hybrid pay arrangements can create a balance for employees to ensure they have financial stability while also being incentivized to work harder for more pay. In some cases, and depending on the job position and industry, employees who are on a salary and wage hybrid pay structure may also have access to benefits such as health insurance, paid time off or sick days, depending on the number of hours they have worked during a specified period. Additionally, employees on hybrid pay structures should ensure they are aware of labour laws specific to their region to ensure they are being compensated properly for the hours worked.', ""Certainly! Benefits are an essential aspect of an employee's compensation package and can differ significantly between salaried and hourly employees. Here are some of the differences:\n\nHealth Insurance: Generally, salaried employees are more likely to receive health insurance as part of their benefits package. In most cases, employers tend to offer health care benefits such as medical, dental and vision coverage to full-time salaried employees, while hourly employees may have to work a minimum number of hours before qualifying for these benefits. This is because employers pay a percentage of the premium paid by employees, which can be costly for them to extend to hourly workers. Paid Time Off: Salaried employees tend to receive paid vacation days or paid time off benefits, which hourly employees may not. However, some employers may offer hourly workers paid time off based on hours worked, but there may be a longer waiting period before employees are eligible. Retirement Benefits: Employer contributions to retirement plans such as 401(k) or pensions are generally more common in salaried positions, especially those in finance, tech or large-scale corporations. Hourly workers may also have access to retirement accounts, but in most cases, employers will not match contributions. Other Benefits: Salaried employees may also have other benefits like life insurance, disability benefits, flexible work time, and wellness programs. For example, tech companies like Google and Facebook tend to offer more comprehensive employee benefits packages, including additional perks like free meals, gyms or even entertainment options, to attract top talent. In terms of industries that tend to offer better benefits packages overall, it is difficult to generalize since benefits packages can vary widely depending on the employer, the industry, and location. However, in general, industries that have a lot of competition for talent tend to offer more comprehensive benefits packages to attract top-tier candidates. Some examples of industries that tend to offer better benefits packages include tech companies, finance industry, and healthcare providers. To sum up, salaried employees tend to receive more benefits than hourly employees, though some benefits like retirement accounts, paid time off, and health benefits may depend on the amount of work experience or whether the employee works full or part-time. It's essential for job candidates to review and evaluate the benefits that come with the job offer entirely, taking into account their preferences and priorities when comparing job offers between sectors.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

The pandemic's effects have been particularly noteworthy in terms of domestic and international tourism, leisure tourism, and business tourism.\n\nDomestic Tourism:\nDomestic tourism has been one of the few areas in the tourism industry that has experienced some positive growth opportunities since the pandemic hit. With many international borders closed or only opening gradually, many people are opting for domestic travel as a substitute. As a result, domestic tourism activity has surged in many destinations, particularly in outdoor areas such as National Parks, rural landscapes, and coastal communities.\n\nInternational Tourism:\nThe travel restrictions and inter-country border closures have led to a significant setback for international tourism. With international movement restricted, the number of foreign visitors to most destinations has virtually disappeared. The transportation industry, including airlines and cruise ships, has been particularly hard hit, and tourism-dependent countries and communities have seen devastating losses in revenue and job opportunities.\n\nLeisure Tourism:\nThe pandemic has triggered a significant shift in tourist demand. Many people are now traveling to places closer to home, and those who are traveling overseas are often opting for more outdoor destinations or rural areas instead of crowed urban cities or theme parks. This demand shift has compelled many tourism players to reorganize their product offerings to cater to this new trend, such as introducing more outdoor activities, local experiences, or alternative modes of transportation.\n\nBusiness Tourism:\nThe pandemic has also had a significant impact on business tourism. With much of the world still stuck with travel restrictions and working-from-home setups, travel for business purposes has taken a significant hit. Many international business events and conferences have moved online, while others are being postponed until further notice. Thus, the hospitality industry targeted at catering to business travelers, such as hotels, convention centers, and restaurants, has been negatively impacted as long as the pandemic continues.\n\nIn conclusion, the global pandemic has had a significant impact on tourism in all of its forms. With the reopening of businesses and borders, there is hope for recovery in the sector, but the future remains uncertain, and we may see a significant shift in both the supply and demand for tourism that may restructure the industry in the long term."", ""Sure! Here are some examples of how popular tourist destinations around the world have been impacted by COVID-19 in terms of revenue and job losses:\n\n1. Europe: According to the European Union, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a 52% decline in international tourist arrivals in Europe in the first eight months of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The World Tourism Organization estimates that Europe will see a 70% reduction in international tourist arrivals for the year 2020, which will result in a loss of $1.4 trillion in revenue and up to 27 million job losses. 2. USA: The U.S. Travel industry was hit hard by the pandemic, with many states imposing strict travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. According to the U.S. Travel Association, the pandemic's impact on the travel industry could result in a loss of $505 billion in travel spending for 2020 and a loss of up to 4.6 million jobs. 3. Thailand: Thailand's tourism industry is one of the country's main sources of income, accounting for up to 20% of its gross domestic product (GDP). According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, the pandemic has resulted in a revenue loss of $50 billion in the first half of 2020, and up to 3 million job losses in the tourism industry. 4. Australia: Tourism Australia estimates that the country's tourism industry could see a loss of up to $55 billion in spending for the year 2020, resulting in up to 610,000 job losses. 5. Caribbean: The Caribbean region is highly dependent on tourism, accounting for up to 15% of the region's GDP. The Caribbean Tourism Organization predicts that the pandemic could result in a loss of up to $900 billion in tourism revenue and up to 11 million job losses in the region. These are just a few examples of how the pandemic has impacted popular tourist destinations worldwide. The impact on revenue and job losses will vary depending on the economic structure of each country and their reliance on the travel and tourism industry."", 'Sure! Here are some details on how the pandemic has affected job losses in the cruise industry and how tourism-dependent countries are coping with revenue loss:\n\nJob Losses in the Cruise Industry:\nThe cruise industry has been one of the most severely affected by the pandemic, with most cruise ships forced to dock and cancel sailings. According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the suspension of the cruise industry affects nearly 1.2 million jobs and leads to a loss of $50 billion in economic activities worldwide. In the United States alone, the CLIA estimates that the suspension of cruise operations could lead to a loss of $32 billion in direct spending, resulting in over 250,000 job losses. Coping with Revenue Loss:\nTourism-dependent countries are employing a range of strategies and measures to cope with the revenue loss caused by the pandemic. Some common coping strategies include:\n\n1. Stimulus measures: Governments of several countries have implemented stimulus measures aimed at supporting the tourism industry, such as providing financial support to tourism businesses and offering grants or tax relief to encourage investment in the sector. 2. Reopening borders: Several countries are reopening their borders to international tourists to boost tourism activity. However, these efforts are often taken cautiously in order to avoid a widespread outbreak of the virus. 3. Domestic tourism promotion: Since domestic tourism has been less affected by the pandemic, several countries have focused on promoting domestic tourist activity to boost their local tourism industry. 4. Diversification of tourism offerings: Some countries are diversifying their tourism offerings to attract different types of tourists, such as focusing on eco-tourism, adventure tourism, or cultural tourism. 5. Collaboration: Countries are collaborating with each other to find joint solutions to the impact of the pandemic on international tourism. For example, the UK and the Caribbean countries have formed a partnership to promote sustainable tourism practices and increase collaboration between the two regions.

While working from home has its benefits, it also poses significant challenges to the mental health of remote workers. Isolation, burnout, and poor work-life balance are some of the common challenges that remote workers face. These challenges can have negative impacts on the well-being and productivity of remote workers. Therefore, it is essential to explore these challenges and identify strategies that can be employed to address them. This paper provides an overview of the challenges that remote workers face and offers evidence-based strategies for addressing these challenges.\n\nKeywords: Remote work, mental health, isolation, burnout, work-life balance. \n\nIntroduction\n\nRemote work has gained popularity in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of remote work as organizations were forced to shut down their physical offices to curb the spread of the virus. While remote work has its benefits, it also poses significant challenges. One of the significant challenges that remote workers face is poor mental health. Remote work can be isolating, and this, coupled with poor work-life balance and burnout, can impact remote workers' mental health. This paper explores the specific challenges remote workers face regarding mental health, including isolation, burnout, and poor work-life balance. It also provides evidence-based strategies that can be employed to address these challenges.\n\nIsolation\n\nIsolation is one of the significant challenges that remote workers face. Unlike office workers who interact with colleagues, remote workers often work alone, and this can result in feelings of loneliness and isolation. Isolation can result in reduced job satisfaction and motivation, depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems (Scherer, Saklofske, & Holdnack, 2019). To address isolation, organizations can use various tools to foster connections between remote workers. Communication tools such as Slack, Zoom, Skype, and other virtual tools can be used to encourage communication and collaboration among remote workers. Regular virtual meetings, virtual happy hours, and other social activities can help remote workers feel connected to their colleagues despite working remotely. These strategies can help to mitigate the negative effects of isolation on remote workers' mental health.\n\nBurnout\n\nBurnout is another challenge that remote workers often face. Remote workers may be expected to work longer hours or even be available at all times since there is no clear boundary between work and personal life (Ghosal, Kumar, & Ranganathan, 2021). Burnout can result in exhaustion, detachment, and cynicism towards work, which can impact not only the well-being of remote workers but also their productivity. \nOrganizations can help to mitigate the risk of burnout by providing remote workers with flexible work schedules. This can enable them to have a better work-life balance and engage in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and spending time with family and friends. Additionally, organizations can encourage remote workers to take breaks during the day and ensure that they have time off to recharge. Employers can also provide resources such as virtual mental health services to help remote workers manage stress and avoid burnout.\n\nWork-life Balance\n\nRemote work can significantly impact the work-life balance of employees. Remote workers may find it challenging to separate work from their personal lives since they work from home. This can lead to longer work hours and reduced family time, which can impact their mental health negatively (Schonfeld, & Bianchi, 2016). Organizations can address this challenge by setting clear expectations for remote work outside regular working hours. Employers can also encourage remote workers to take breaks during the day, stop working at designated times, and take regular holidays to recharge. These strategies can help remote workers to achieve a better work-life balance, which can positively impact their mental health.\n\nConclusion\n\nRemote work has become the new normal for many organizations worldwide. While it has its benefits, it also poses significant challenges to remote workers' mental health. Isolation, burnout, and work-life balance are some of the common challenges that remote workers face. These challenges can have negative impacts on remote workers' productivity and well-being, making it essential to address them. This paper has highlighted evidence-based strategies that can be used to address these challenges. Communication tools, virtual mental health resources, and flexible work schedules are among the strategies that can help remote workers to maintain good mental health. Organizations can use these strategies to promote a healthy work environment that supports the mental health of remote workers.\n\nReferences\n\nGhosal, D., Kumar, V., & Ranganathan, P. (2021).

Journal of Business Research, 126, 609-619.\n\nScherer, M., Saklofske,"", 'Of course! In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the availability of virtual mental health resources for remote workers. These resources include teletherapy, online counseling, chatbot therapy, and mental health apps, among others. Teletherapy involves remote sessions with licensed mental health professionals through video or phone calls. This service has become increasingly popular among remote workers who need mental health support but cannot access in-person therapy due to distance or time constraints. Teletherapy has been found to be effective, with studies showing that it can be as effective as in-person therapy (Berryhill et al., 2019). Online counseling is another resource that has gained popularity among remote workers. This service involves accessing therapy or counseling services through web-based platforms. These platforms provide confidential and secure channels for remote workers to discuss their mental health concerns with licensed professionals. Online counseling has been found to be an effective way of delivering mental health services, especially for individuals who are unable to access in-person services (Sucala et al., 2018). Chatbot therapy is a newer resource in the virtual mental health space. It involves interacting with chatbots that use artificial intelligence to provide mental health support. Chatbot therapy can be accessed through messaging apps, websites, or mobile apps. While it is still relatively new, early studies have shown that chatbot therapy can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). Mental health apps are mobile applications that provide mental health support and resources. These apps can be used to track moods, set reminders for self-care activities, provide guided meditations, and connect users with licensed mental health professionals. While mental health apps are widely available, their effectiveness varies. Users should research and choose evidence-based apps that have been reviewed by mental health experts. In conclusion, virtual mental health resources have become increasingly available for remote workers. Teletherapy, online counseling, chatbot therapy, and mental health apps are some of the resources that remote workers can access to receive mental health support. These resources have been found to be effective in improving mental health outcomes, but users should research and choose evidence-based resources that are appropriate for their needs.

The streets were now deserted, save for the occasional shriek of a zombie or the sound of a gunshot. The survivors of this world were few and far between, and though they had banded together, there was always a sense of unease in the air - the knowledge that at any moment, the undead could come for them.\n\nBut they had survived for this long, and they were determined to continue to do so. They had found a safe haven, a boarded-up hotel that still had food and water. They had set up barricades and created safe zones, all the while knowing that it was only a matter of time before the zombies would break through.\n\nThe group was small, just four in number. There was Jack, the former police officer who had seen it all before, and his wife, Sophia, who had never been more than a teacher. There was also Tom, a young man who had been studying to be a doctor before the world as they knew it ended and Kiera, the youngest of the group, a teenager who had lost her family in the chaos.\n\nOn this particular day, they decided to send Jack and Tom on a supply run while Sophia and Kiera held down the fort. The men were long gone when the women heard a crash from the other end of the hotel. At first, they thought it was the zombies, but as they crept towards the sound, they realised that it was coming from one of the hotel rooms.\n\nSlowly, they inched towards the door, listening for any sound from inside. They heard nothing, but the undead could be silent too, so they took no chances. Together, they had to use all their strength to push the barricade out of the way and enter the room, where they found the source of the noise.\n\nThe room was in shambles, and the window had been smashed. It was a zombie that had broken in but had since been killed. They thought it must have been someone else who had found their way into the hotel and was scavenging for supplies. They searched the room for any sign of the intruder but found nothing.\n\nAs they were about to leave, Kiera saw something move from beneath the bed. It was a hand, gnarled, and decaying. She gasped, but Sophia was quick to react, pulling out her gun and shooting at the arm. The hand fell away, and the zombie started to crawl out from under the bed.\n\nKiera screamed, and Sophia and Kiera, both terrified, ran out of the room, slamming the door shut behind them. Sophia called out for Jack and Tom over the walkie-talkie, but they didn't respond. The women realised that they were on their own.\n\nThe zombie wasn't giving up. It had made its way to the door and had started breaking it down. The sound of the zombie banging against the door and Kiera's screams filled the air.\n\nJust when they thought it was over, they heard a cacophony of noise from outside the door. It was Jack and Tom, back from their supply run. They had heard the commotion and had come running. They finally busted the door open, revealing a zombie with a bloody face that was now attacking Kiera in full force.\n\nWith the help of her companions, Sophia managed to pull the zombie off Kiera and shoot it right in the head. The explosion of gore and blood that came out of it was horrific, but it was life or death, and Sophia knew that better than anybody.\n\nAfter the ordeal was over, they realised they had lost precious time – time they could have spent finding a more secure place or preparing for the next attack. But they were alive, and they knew that was worth everything. As the sun set and they tended to their wounded, they slept with one eye open, knowing that the undead were still out there, and that the next attack they encountered may not be as easily dealt with."", ""Jack had been a police officer for over twenty years, a job he had taken to help keep the peace in the city he lived in. He had seen more than his fair share of horrific things, but nothing could have prepared him for the zombie apocalypse. Despite his fears and the loss of many of his colleagues early on, Jack found the strength to continue on, driven by his desire to protect those who were left.\n\nSophia, on the other hand, had always been a teacher. She had taught middle school for years before the world fell apart, and it was her natural instinct to care for others that kept her going. In an apocalypse where there was little to no hope, Sophia tried to bring a sense of normalcy to the group, cooking meals and organizing games to help them cope with their situation.\n\nTom had been a pre-med student, studying medicine with the hope of one day helping those in need. When the world ended, he found himself thrust into a world where he was one of the few people left who knew how to treat injuries and illnesses. Tom knew that he had a responsibility to use his skills to help others, and that's what kept him going.\n\nKiera was the youngest of the group, a teenager who had lost her family in the chaos. She was fiercely independent but also struggled with feelings of loneliness and hopelessness. Despite her grief, Kiera was determined to survive and to prove to the others that she was strong enough to handle the hardships that came with living in a zombie-infested world.\n\nEach of these characters had their own motivations for continuing on in the apocalypse, but together they found strength in each other. They were all survivors, and they knew that the only way to make it through was to rely on each other and to never give up hope, no matter how dire the situation might seem."", ""The day was hot and stifling, the kind of heat that clung to you like a sticky second skin. The streets were littered with debris and bits of broken concrete, and the smell of decay hung heavy in the air. The sky was a grim and apocalyptic gray, the world around them a harsh, unforgiving wasteland that offered little hope.\n\nJack and Tom walked down the empty street, their eyes scanning the buildings around them for any signs of life. Every time they heard a noise or saw a movement, their hands instinctively went to their weapons. The sound of their breathing was labored and heavy in the silence.\n\nBack at the hotel, Sophia and Kiera were on edge. They knew that the world outside was dangerous, and they could always feel the presence of the undead lurking just outside their safe haven. Every creak of the old building made them jump, and they couldn't shake the feeling that they were never truly safe.\n\nWhen they heard the crash, they froze. It was a sound they had heard before - a zombie breaking through a barrier. Sophia's heart raced as she helped Kiera push aside the barricade, her gun at the ready. They slowly made their way towards the sound, their hearts pounding in their chests.\n\nThe room was a mess, the result of a violent struggle. Broken glass and overturned furniture littered the floor, and the smell of death was overpowering. But it was the sight of the zombie crawling out from under the bed that sent shivers down their spine.

Creating realistic holographic displays can add a futuristic touch to the environment and make it more interactive. Here are some tips on how to make them look convincing:\n\n1. Lighting: Since holographic displays emit their own light, their lighting should match the environment. For example, a red holographic display should cast a red light onto the objects around it. This way, it will appear as if the hologram is interacting with its surroundings. 2. Depth: Holographic displays should look three-dimensional in order to blend in with their environment. This means that you should create a sense of depth by adding shadows and highlights to it. This will also make the hologram appear to be more solid. 3. Transparency: Holographic displays are translucent, so you need to make sure that they look transparent. This can be achieved by adjusting the opacity of the object and making it slightly transparent. 4. Flicker: Holographic displays should look like they are flickering slightly, which can be achieved through animating the texture of the object. 5. Reflection: Holographic displays should reflect the world around them. This can be achieved by adding reflective elements to the hologram. 6. Interface: You can also add a user interface that allows the people in the environment to interact with the holographic display. You can create buttons, sliders or touch screens that are part of the hologram. By using these techniques, you can create convincing and realistic holographic displays in your Blender project that enhance the environment and make it more interactive.', ""Certainly!

"['Education WA: Assessment and reporting, not more exemplars!\nI notice with despair that systemically we are going through another attempt at defining what an A -E is for a variety of topics and year groups to help teachers accurately mark assessment. I wonder how long it will take ""those in the know"" that providing A-E definitions either is so cumbersome with detail that it is impossible to use or too vague to be of any real use.\nThere are good reasons why teachers have used percentage grades (and not exemplars or rubrics) historically to assist in judging grades. Percentages combined with basic teacher judgement has been the only valid tool for judging students A-E on assessments. The simple fact is that teachers gain accuracy in assessing students over many years and by teaching as many year groups as possible in their sector (primary or secondary). By watching students mature into more capable students, teachers are better able to determine the snapshot grade of students and judge what makes a student an A (in any given year) and what type of student deserves B-E or the politically incorrect and now defunct F.\nThe sheer breadth of the curriculum and the variety of responses by students makes the task of defining A-E for all topics in all learning areas a task that serves no real purpose. Teachers do not have the time to find and refer to these exemplars when marking nor are the exemplars accurate for a variety of socioeconomic sectors (yes, I am saying an A in a low socioeconomic area is lower than a higher socioeconomic area by reducing amounts until TEE examinations). Much of marking is viewing the material of the student, noting key issues and making a teacher judgement on where the student is positioned on a continuum. As more students are guided through to TEE (or yr 7 graduation) by a teacher, teachers get better at giving feedback to students with information that helps them reach their potential.\nThat is what teachers are paid for, they get better with experience and this experience (or lack of) should be valued where accurate and monitored and augmented by senior staff whilst experience is being gained.\n(...now if we were being given EPW\'s with solutions for all maths NCOS then I might give a little cheer as a good use of systemic resources). Based on the passage above, Could you summarize the author\'s argument against defining A-E for all topics in all learning areas?', 'Can you provide me with some resources or guidance on how to improve my teacher judgement when assessing students?']",,"['The author argues that providing A-E definitions for all topics in all learning areas is not useful because it is too cumbersome with detail or too vague.

"['Can you explain the concept of blocking in stage productions?', ""How important is blocking in stage productions? Can't the actors just figure out where to go on their own?"", ""Can't the actors just figure out their own blocking? It seems like a waste of time and money to have a director choreograph their every movement."", ""Come on, isn't blocking just a way for the director to show off their control over the actors? It doesn't seem like it adds that much to the performance."", ""I still think blocking is overrated. Why can't actors just move around the stage naturally and spontaneously? It would make for a more dynamic and exciting performance."", ""But isn't blocking just an excuse for directors to boss around the actors and make them do whatever they want? They're just trying to flex their power and control.""]",,"['Blocking in stage productions refers to the process of planning and choreographing the movement and placement of actors on stage during a performance. It involves the director deciding where each actor should be positioned at various points in the play or musical, how they should move around the stage, and when they should enter and exit. The blocking is usually written out in a script and rehearsed extensively by the actors to ensure that the performance flows smoothly and effectively communicates the story to the audience. Blocking also helps to ensure that each actor is visible and audible to the audience, and that there is no confusion or chaos on stage.', 'Blocking is extremely important in stage productions. While actors could theoretically figure out where to go on their own, without blocking, the performance would lack structure and consistency. Blocking ensures that actors are in the right places at the right times, making it easier for the audience to follow the story and appreciate the performance. Additionally, blocking can help create a certain atmosphere or mood on stage, which can be crucial to the success of the production. Finally, blocking is essential for safety reasons; actors need to be aware of where each other are in order to avoid collisions or mishaps. In short, while some improvisation is possible, blocking is a critical element of successful stage productions.', 'While there is certainly some room for actors to contribute to the blocking process, having a director to choreograph the blocking is essential for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the director has a broader perspective on the production as a whole and can make informed decisions about which movements will be most effective for telling the story and engaging the audience. \n\nSecond, a director can ensure that the blocking is consistent from rehearsal to rehearsal and from performance to performance. This can be especially important when there are multiple actors on stage simultaneously, each with their own movements to coordinate.\n\nFinally, the director can incorporate their own artistic vision into the blocking, creating a more cohesive and polished production overall. \n\nWhile it may seem like an unnecessary expense, having a director to choreograph the blocking is essential to the success of any professional stage production.', ""Blocking is not primarily a way for directors to show off their control over the actors but is rather an essential part of the theatrical production process. A carefully planned and well-executed blocking can greatly enhance the audience's understanding and engagement with the story being told, helping to ensure that the message of the performance is communicated clearly and effectively. \n\nMoreover, good blocking can also help to create a sense of realism and naturalness in a performance. Without clear instructions on where to go and how to move, actors may end up standing awkwardly, or bumping into each other accidentally, which can be distracting for the audience.\n\nWhile it's true that some directors may try to exert excessive control over their actors through overbearing blocking, in general, good directors collaborate with their actors to create blocking that feels organic and believable while also serving the needs of the performance. In short, while blocking may not seem like a glamorous part of the production process, it is a critical aspect of creating a successful theatrical experience."", ""While it's true that natural movement and spontaneity can be a powerful tool in some productions, the reality is that true spontaneity in theatre is rare. Blocking is a necessary part of any production because it provides structure and predictability, both of which are important for telling the story and creating a compelling theatrical experience. \n\nIn addition, effective blocking can actually enhance the audience's perception of spontaneity. When actors move naturally within a highly structured blocking plan, it creates the illusion of improvisation while still ensuring that the actors are in the right place at the right time and that the performance is cohesive and understandable.\n\nFinally, even seemingly spontaneous moments in theatre are often well-planned and rehearsed in advance. As much as we may want to believe that great theatre is an entirely in-the-moment experience, the reality is that even the most seemingly chaotic and unstructured performances are carefully crafted by highly skilled professionals. \n\nIn short, while natural movement and spontaneity can be powerful tools in theatre, they are not a substitute for good blocking. Without structured and rehearsed blocking, productions run the risk of being disorganized, confusing, and ultimately less engaging for the audience."", ""It's certainly true that some directors may use blocking as a way to exert control over their actors, but this is not the norm. A good director knows that the best performances come from collaboration and trust between the director and the actors, and that effective directing involves creating a safe and supportive space in which actors can explore their characters and their movements on stage.\n\nBlocking is an essential part of this process, as it helps to ensure that the actors are in the right place at the right time and that they are working together seamlessly to tell the story. However, good blocking is also flexible and responsive to the needs of the actors and the production, and a good director will always be open to feedback and adjustments.\n\nUltimately, the goal of blocking is not to exert power and control over the actors, but to help them create a compelling and engaging performance that brings the story to life for the audience. While there may be some directors who abuse their power in this regard, in general, blocking is a collaborative and creative process that is designed to empower and support the actors and to help them deliver their best possible performance.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

In addition to these classic ingredients, a few extra touches can really take the flavor to the next level.\n\nFor example, using high-quality butter, such as European-style or cultured butter, can add a deeper and more complex flavor to the dough. Brown sugar, with its molasses notes, can also make a difference, providing a richer and more caramelly flavor than white sugar alone.\n\nVanilla extract is another essential ingredient that gives the cookies a warm and aromatic flavor. A pinch of sea salt can provide a subtle, savory note that balances out the sweetness of the dough and chocolate.\n\nOf course, the star of the recipe is the chocolate chips themselves. Many bakers prefer using semisweet or dark chocolate chips for a richer and more complex flavor, while others may opt for milk chocolate or a combination of different types. Using high-quality chocolate, with a cocoa content of at least 60%, can really elevate the flavor of the cookies and make them truly indulgent.\n\nOverall, it's the perfect combination of these ingredients, in just the right amounts, that make a fresh chocolate chip cookie so special and delicious. Each bite is a symphony of flavors that's both comforting and complex, providing a sensory experience that's truly unforgettable.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

While painting certainly would have been present in the region, the medium does not preserve well over time, and as a result, most examples of Roman painting have not survived. \n\nHowever, we do know that the Romans did bring with them a tradition of painting that was highly influential throughout the Roman Empire. This tradition was heavily influenced by Greek painting and was characterized by a focus on realistic representation, perspective, and illusionism. This tradition continued to evolve throughout the Roman period, with painters exploring new methods of representation and experimenting with different styles and techniques.\n\nOne area where Roman painting was particularly influential was in the creation of large-scale frescoes, which were used to decorate public and private buildings throughout the Empire. These frescoes often depicted mythological or historical scenes, and were characterized by their bright colors and detailed compositions.\n\nWhile we don't know much about the specifics of painting in Hispania Baetica during the Roman period, it's likely that the Roman tradition of painting would have had some influence on the local artistic community.

This is quite informative. Can you add more examples of ncRNAs and the mechanisms through which they regulate gene expression?']",,"[""Introduction:\nGene expression is a fundamental biological process that plays a critical role in the development and functioning of all living organisms. Gene expression is a multistep process that includes transcription, RNA processing, translation, and protein folding. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules that are not translated into proteins but play important regulatory roles in gene expression. The regulation of gene expression by ncRNAs occurs at various levels, including transcription, RNA processing, and translation. In this article, we will discuss the process of gene expression and the role of ncRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.\n\nGene Expression:\nThe process of gene expression begins with the transcription of DNA into RNA by RNA polymerase. Transcription is a complex process that involves the recognition of specific DNA sequences in a gene by RNA polymerase, the unwinding of the double-stranded DNA, and the initiation of RNA synthesis. The synthesized RNA is a primary transcript that requires further processing before it can be translated into a protein. This processing involves the addition of a 5' cap, a poly-A tail, and the removal of introns.\n\nAfter RNA processing, the mature mRNA is transported out of the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it is translated by ribosomes into a protein. Translation is the process of converting the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA into a specific sequence of amino acids that, when folded into a three-dimensional structure, forms a functional protein.\n\nRole of Non-coding RNAs:\nNon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules that do not code for proteins. They play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression at various levels, including transcription, RNA processing, and translation. There are several classes of ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs).\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that are approximately 22 nucleotides in length. They play a significant role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA transcripts, resulting in either the degradation of the target mRNA or the inhibition of its translation into a protein. MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis.\n\nSmall interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are similar to miRNAs in that they are also small RNA molecules that play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. They are typically produced through exogenous RNA interference (RNAi) or endogenous RNAi pathways. When they are introduced into the cell, they can cause the degradation of complementary mRNA molecules or inhibit their translation, resulting in the downregulation of the target gene. SiRNAs have been used as a tool in gene therapy and as a potential therapeutic agent for various diseases, including viral infections and cancer.\n\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules that are longer than 200 nucleotides and do not encode proteins. They play diverse regulatory roles in gene expression, ranging from epigenetic regulation to post-transcriptional regulation. LncRNAs have been shown to regulate gene expression through various mechanisms, including chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, and mRNA processing. They have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently discovered class of ncRNAs that form a covalently closed circular structure. They play a regulatory role in gene expression by sequestering miRNAs, thereby preventing them from binding to their target mRNA molecules. Many circRNAs are highly conserved across species, and their expression patterns have been shown to be tissue-specific. They have been implicated in various biological processes, including development, aging, and tumorigenesis.\n\nResearch in the Field:\nResearch in the field of ncRNA biology has revealed an intricate and complex network of regulatory interactions that play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. The discovery of a vast array of ncRNAs has opened up new avenues for the development of therapeutic targets and diagnostics for various diseases. Recent studies have shown that ncRNAs play a role in a wide range of biological processes, including development, differentiation, and disease.\n\nOne example of the role of ncRNAs in disease is the association of lncRNAs with cancer. LncRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in various types of cancer and are thought to contribute to tumor progression and metastasis by altering gene expression patterns. Similarly, miRNAs have been found to play a role in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, gene expression is a multistep process that plays a critical role in the development and functioning of all living organisms. Non-coding RN"", 'Sure! Here are a few more examples of ncRNAs and how they regulate gene expression:\n\n1. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs): piRNAs are small RNA molecules that interact with PIWI proteins and play a role in the silencing of transposable elements (TEs) in germ cells. TEs are mobile genetic components that can disrupt the genome and cause mutations. PiRNAs are transcribed from discrete genomic loci and are thought to recognize and target complementary TE sequences, resulting in their silencing.\n\n2. Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs): rRNAs are the most abundant ncRNAs in the cell and are essential for protein synthesis. They are transcribed from multiple genomic loci and are processed into mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. The abundance of rRNAs is tightly regulated and can be influenced by various environmental factors, such as nutrient availability and growth factors.\n\n3. Transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs): tiRNAs are small RNA molecules that are generated during transcription initiation and have been shown to play a role in regulating gene expression. They are thought to modulate transcription initiation by binding to RNA polymerase and altering the recruitment of transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes.\n\n4. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs): eRNAs are a class of lncRNAs that are transcribed from enhancer regions of the genome and have been shown to activate gene expression through a variety of mechanisms. They can interact with transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to promote transcription, recruit chromatin remodeling complexes, and enhance enhancer-promoter looping.\n\n5. Antisense transcripts: Antisense transcripts are RNA molecules that are transcribed from the opposite DNA strand of a protein-coding gene, often overlapping with the sense transcript. They can regulate gene expression by various mechanisms, including transcriptional interference and RNA decay. Through transcriptional interference, antisense transcripts can inhibit the expression of the sense transcript by competing for transcription factors or RNA polymerase II. Additionally, they can destabilize the sense transcript by binding to it and promoting RNA degradation.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the diverse functions and mechanisms of ncRNAs in regulating gene expression.

Answer according to: SHAWNEE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, and UNITED STATES ATTORNEY JARED MAAG, Defendants.\nPlaintiff Donald Alvin Womack, Jr., proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, has filed the above-captioned action against Defendants the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office and United States Attorney Jared Maag. When a plaintiff proceeds in forma pauperis, the court may review the complaint under 28 U.S.C. 1915(e)(2). That section authorizes the court to dismiss the case if the court determines that the action “(i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.” In this case, the magistrate judge recommends the district judge dismiss this action without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and because plaintiff is seeking relief from a defendant who would be immune from such relief.\nThe court uses the Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion-to-dismiss standard to determine whether dismissal under Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is appropriate. The court liberally construes pro se parties' pleadings and will accept as true all well-pleaded facts, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. However, the plaintiff still bears the burden of alleging sufficient facts upon which a recognized legal claim could be based. The court cannot assume the responsibility of serving as plaintiff's attorney in constructing arguments or scouring the record for a possible cause of action. The plaintiff “must allege sufficient facts to state a claim which is plausible-rather than merely conceivable-on its face.” Dismissal is appropriate when the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts alleged, and it would be futile to give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend.\nBroadly construing Mr. Womack's “kidnapping” claim, it appears Mr. Womack asserts that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated during the one-month period of incarceration after Mr. Maag allegedly informed Mr. Womack's attorney that he was waiting to see if the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office would charge Mr. Womack again before seeking dismissal of the federal indictment. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by government actors and generally applies to claims of wrongful detention. Mr. Womack's claims stem from his detention in federal custody. Because the Shawnee County District Attorney's office did not “seize” plaintiff within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment during the period giving rise to the claim, plaintiff does not state a claim against this defendant. Additionally, sub-governmental entities like district attorneys' offices are generally not capable of being sued.\nMr. Womack also fails to state a claim against Mr. Maag. Mr. Womack has used a form § 1983 complaint. However, to state a § 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of Constitutional rights by a person acting under the color of state law. Although Mr. Womack has checked the box on the form complaint indicating that Mr. Maag was acting under the color of state law, the complaint is void of any factual allegations supporting this assertion. Rather, Mr. Maag, a federal prosecutor, would have been acting under the color of federal authority when he served as the prosecuting attorney on Mr. Womack's federal criminal case. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents has been interpreted to create a cause of action against federal actors similar to § 1983 claims against state actors. Even liberally construing Mr. Womack's complaint as asserting a Bivens claim, the complaint still does not state a claim for a Fourth Amendment violation. Pretrial detention constitutes a seizure. The seizure is reasonable if the criminal charges are supported by probable cause. In this case, the complaint fails to allege that the federal criminal charge was not supported by probable cause. In fact, the court takes judicial notice that Mr. Womack was indicted by a grand jury, which requires a finding by the grand jury that probable cause existed. Because plaintiff's seizure was reasonable, Mr. Maag did not violate Mr. Womack's Fourth Amendment rights.\nMr. Womack's complaint does not specify what relief Mr. Womack seeks or whether Mr. Maag is being sued in his individual or official capacity. Regardless, Mr. Maag is almost certainly immune from suit. Prosecutorial immunity shields prosecutors from liability in initiating or presenting the government's case against a criminal defendant. It extends to “questions of whether to present a case to a grand jury, whether to file an information, whether and when to prosecute, whether to dismiss an indictment against particular defendants, which witnesses to call, and what other evidence to present.” The timing of Mr. Maag's motion to dismiss a charge supported by probable cause falls within these categories, and therefore, he would be entitled to prosecutorial immunity. Additionally, suits against a federal-government official acting in his official-capacity are suits against the United States. Sovereign immunity bars suits against the United States unless it has waived immunity,  and the United States has not waived immunity in Bivens actions. Therefore, plaintiff's claim against Mr. Maag in his official capacity would also be barred.\nFor these reasons, the magistrate judge recommends the district judge dismiss this action because plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted and because plaintiff is seeking relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 636(b)(1) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 72, plaintiff shall have fourteen (14) days after service of a copy of this Report and Recommendation to file any written objections. A party must file any objections within the fourteen-day period if that party wants to have appellate review of the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, or recommended disposition. If no objections are timely filed, no appellate review will be allowed by any court.\n Compl. At 4, ECF No. 1.\n Compl.

Specifically, Womack's claims that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated during his detention in federal custody did not hold up as the Shawnee County District Attorney's office did not seize him within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and Mr. Maag did not violate Womack's Fourth Amendment rights because the federal criminal charge was supported by probable cause.

Womack accused both the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office and Maag of acts that violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

Do they have a significant impact?"", 'Wow, I had no idea that international policies and organizations had such a significant impact on education systems around the world. Do you think that countries with weaker education systems could benefit more from such initiatives and support?']",,"['The education system varies in different countries around the world in a number of ways, including:\n\n1. Curriculum: Different countries have different curriculums that are customized to meet their unique needs. For instance, while some countries emphasize science and mathematics, others may have a more literature-based or social science-based curriculum. \n\n2. Funding: The education system in different countries also varies in terms of funding. While some countries have a public education system that is fully funded by the government, others may rely on private funding, endowments, or donations to finance their educational programs. \n\n3. Academic requirements: The academic requirements in different countries may vary, depending on the level of education and the subject area. For example, some countries may require students to take standardized tests or pass a certain number of classes in order to graduate, while others may have more flexible academic requirements. \n\n4. Teaching styles: The way that teachers are trained and expected to teach can also vary drastically from one country to another. While some countries may emphasize rote learning, others may emphasize hands-on, experiential learning. \n\n5. Education philosophy: Different cultures have different educational philosophies, which inform the way that their education systems operate. For example, some countries may emphasize the importance of individual achievement, while others may prioritize social or collective learning. \n\nOverall, the education system around the world is diverse and continually evolving, with each country adapting its educational goals and practices to meet its unique cultural, social, and economic needs.', 'Yes, there are many countries with unique educational systems that are worth exploring. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Finland: The Finnish education system is often cited as one of the best in the world, and for good reason. Finnish schools emphasize unstructured, student-led learning, with no standardized testing until age 16. Teachers have a lot of autonomy and are highly respected in society.\n\n2. Japan: The Japanese education system is known for its rigorous academic standards and emphasis on discipline and hard work. Students often attend cram schools in addition to regular classes to prepare for entrance exams.\n\n3. Prussia/Germany: Modern schooling, as we know it today, was first implemented in Prussia (now part of Germany) in the late 18th century. Their education system was based on obedience, discipline, and uniformity, with a focus on military readiness.\n\n4. Montessori: The Montessori approach to education is a child-centered learning method that emphasizes hands-on, experiential learning. Montessori schools are student-led, with teachers as facilitators rather than lecturers.\n\n5. Bhutan: The Bhutanese government places a high value on Gross National Happiness (GNH), which includes education as one of its pillars. Bhutanese schools teach students to value community and spirituality, in addition to academic subjects.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how education systems can differ across the world. Each country has its own unique educational philosophy that reflects its cultural, social, and economic values.', 'Yes, there are many examples of countries that have made changes to their educational systems and have seen a noticeable impact on their societies. Here are a few examples to consider:\n\n1. South Korea: South Korea has undergone significant changes to its education system since the 1960s. A focus on science, math and technology education, highly competitive examination systems, and cram schools were introduced. These changes transformed the country from a poor, agrarian state into a highly industrialized and developed country with one of the highest educational achievement levels in the world.\n\n2. Singapore: In 1997, Singapore implemented its ""Thinking Schools, Learning Nation"" policy aimed at transforming its education system to focus on critical thinking, creativity and communication. This led to significant improvements in student performance and helped Singapore become one of the wealthiest and most developed countries in Asia.\n\n3. Finland: Finnish education reforms in the 1970s and 80s aimed to create a more equitable, student-centered system with fewer standardized tests and more emphasis on play, creativity, and the arts. Since then, Finland has consistently ranked highly in international education comparisons, and notable societal effects include low inequality and high levels of social trust.\n\n4. Cuba: After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba implemented a highly centralized education system focused on social justice and equality. Education became free and compulsory, with a focus on literacy and community involvement. The literacy rate increased significantly from less than 60% pre-revolution to 99.8% in 2019, and Cuba is renowned for having a highly educated population.\n\nThese examples show how changes in education can have profound impacts on a society\'s economic and social development, individual prosperity and social cohesion.', 'Yes, international policies and organizations can have a significant impact on education systems in different countries. The United Nations has created several policies and agreements related to education, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the right to education as a fundamental human right. In addition, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) leads global efforts to improve the quality of education and promote education for all.\n\nThe policies and initiatives of organizations such as UNESCO can have a significant impact on national education systems. For example, the Education for All movement launched by UNESCO in 2000 aimed to meet the basic learning needs of all people, particularly in developing countries. This initiative helped to mobilize resources and support for education around the world and spurred many countries to adopt policies and reforms to improve access to education.\n\nInternational organizations may also provide assistance to countries in developing specific aspects of their education systems. For instance, UNESCO has supported countries in developing curriculum frameworks, improving teacher training, and implementing quality assurance systems.\n\nFurthermore, some international organizations provide funding for educational development projects. For example, The World Bank provides financial support for education projects in low- and middle-income countries. These projects may support increasing access to education, improving the quality of education, and creating environments that enable students to learn and succeed.\n\nIn summary, international policies and organizations such as the United Nations have had a considerable impact on the education systems of many countries, shaping their goals, policies and practices through recognition, mobilizing resources, offering technical support, and funding development initiatives.', 'Yes, countries with weaker education systems can benefit greatly from initiatives and support provided by international policies and organizations. \n\nFirstly, education is fundamental in reducing poverty and inequality, leading to economic growth and development. Aid and funding from international organizations can help improve access and quality of education and support for vulnerable communities and regions. This can lead to more equitable and inclusive education systems, enhancing social mobility and reducing disparities in educational achievement.\n\nSecondly, international initiatives can also provide technical assistance and training to help governments develop capacity and implement programs to improve their education systems. This can include support for curriculum development, teacher training, educational infrastructure, and quality assurance mechanisms. \n\nFinally, international initiatives can also help support policy dialogue and cooperate with local stakeholders to promote effective and sustainable educational reforms. By collaborating and building partnerships between governments, educational institutions, educators, students and civic organizations, the international community can help promote shared visions, best practices, and informed decision-making in improving education.\n\nIn summary, initiatives and support from international policies and organizations can be particularly critical for countries with weaker education systems as they can harness the technical capacities, funding and experience of multinational partners to improve education access, quality, equity, and effectiveness.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

While other children were content to play on the playground, Avery had always felt a restless energy stirring inside of her. It was only as she grew older that she began to understand why.\n\nOne blustery autumn day, Avery was walking home from school when she felt something stirring within her. It was as though the wind was calling to her, beckoning her to come closer. Without even realizing what she was doing, Avery lifted her hand and swept it through the air.\n\nTo her astonishment, the leaves on the trees rustled and the branches swayed in response to the movements of her hand. It was a power unlike anything Avery had ever experienced before, and she was simultaneously thrilled and terrified by the possibilities.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Avery honed her skills with the wind. She practiced controlling its speed and direction, summoning powerful gusts and gentle breezes at will. She could feel the wind responding to her thoughts and desires, and she reveled in the feeling of control it gave her.\n\nBut there was a darker side to Avery's powers as well. When she was angry or scared, the wind would whip into a frenzy around her, tearing branches from trees and knocking down power lines. Avery knew she had to be careful, lest she lose control and hurt someone.\n\nOne day, a tornado touched down in Avery's hometown, devastating the streets and causing countless injuries and deaths. Avery felt a sickening sense of responsibility, knowing that her uncontrolled powers had caused the destruction. But she vowed to do better, to help prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nFrom that day forward, Avery used her powers for good. She joined a team of weather experts who worked tirelessly to predict and prevent disasters, using her control over the wind to redirect hurricanes and calm dangerous storms. It wasn't always easy, and there were times when Avery felt doubtful of whether she could handle the responsibility.\n\nBut when she saw the grateful faces of those who had been spared from disaster, Avery knew it was worth it.

Gusts: These were sudden bursts of powerful wind. Avery could use them to push objects, deflect projectiles, or create an impromptu barrier.\n\n3. Whirlwinds: These were spiraling winds created by powerful convection currents. Avery could use them to create patterns, to lift objects, or even to fly.\n\n4. Tornadoes: These were destructive vortexes of wind that could cause significant damage. Although they were difficult to control, Avery could redirect their path away from populated areas.\n\nAs for how Avery uses her powers in different situations, here are some examples:\n\n1. Power outages: When a storm knocked out power to her neighborhood, Avery used her wind manipulation powers to create a makeshift generator, powering her home until the electricity came back on.\n\n2. Rescue missions: When a group of hikers became lost in the wilderness, Avery was able to use her powers of wind manipulation to locate them by listening to the sound of the wind as it brushed against objects.\n\n3. Natural disasters: During a hurricane, Avery was able to use her powers to steer the storm away from coastal towns, sparing countless lives.\n\n4. Transportation: Rather than relying on traditional modes of transportation, Avery could use her wind manipulation powers to fly, allowing her to travel long distances quickly and efficiently.\n\n5.

"[""Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What is the author's opinion on prioritizing short-term goals in economic policy?\n\nGiven material: On Monday, President Obama will call for a significant increase in spending, reversing the harsh cuts of the past few years. He won’t get all he’s asking for, but it’s a move in the right direction. And it also marks a welcome shift in the discourse. Maybe Washington is starting to get over its narrow-minded, irresponsible obsession with long-run problems and will finally take on the hard issue of short-run gratification instead.\nO.K., I’m being flip to get your attention. I am, however, quite serious. It’s often said that the problem with policy makers is that they’re too focused on the next election, that they look for short-term fixes while ignoring the long run. But the story of economic policy and discourse these past five years has been exactly the opposite.\nThink about it: Faced with mass unemployment and the enormous waste it entails, for years the Beltway elite devoted almost all their energy not to promoting recovery, but to Bowles-Simpsonism — to devising “grand bargains” that would address the supposedly urgent problem of how we’ll pay for Social Security and Medicare a couple of decades from now.\nAnd this bizarre long-termism isn’t just an American phenomenon. Try to talk about the damage wrought by European austerity policies, and you’re all too likely to encounter lectures to the effect that what we really need to discuss is long-term structural reform. Try to discuss Japan’s effort to break out of its decades-long deflationary trap, and you’re sure to encounter claims that monetary and fiscal policy are sideshows, and that deregulation and other structural changes are what’s important.\nAm I saying that the long run doesn’t matter? Of course not, although some forms of long-termism don’t make sense even on their own terms. Think about the notion that “entitlement reform” is an urgent priority. It’s true that many projections suggest that our major social insurance programs will face financial difficulties in the future (although the dramatic slowing of increases in health costs makes even that proposition uncertain). If so, at some point we may need to cut benefits. But why, exactly, is it crucial that we deal with the threat of future benefits cuts by locking in plans to cut future benefits?\nAnyway, even where the long-term issues are real, it’s truly strange that they have so often taken center stage in recent years. We are, after all, still living through the aftermath of a once-in-three-generations financial crisis. America seems, finally, to be recovering — but Bowles-Simpsonism had its greatest influence precisely when the United States economy was still mired in a deep slump. Europe has hardly recovered at all, and there’s overwhelming evidence that austerity policies are the main reason for that ongoing disaster. So why the urge to change the subject to structural reform? The answer, I’d suggest, is intellectual laziness and lack of moral courage.\nAbout laziness: Many people know what John Maynard Keynes said about the long run, but far fewer are aware of the context. Here’s what he really said: “But this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.” Quite. All too often, or so it seems to me, people who insist that questions of austerity and stimulus are unimportant are actually trying to avoid hard thinking about the nature of the economic disaster that has overtaken so much of the world.\nAnd they’re also trying to avoid taking a stand that will expose them to attack. Discussions of short-run fiscal and monetary policy are politically charged. Oppose austerity and support monetary expansion and you’ll be lambasted by the right; do the reverse and you’ll be criticized and maybe ridiculed by the left. I understand why it’s tempting to dismiss the whole debate and declare that the really important issues involve the long run. But while people who say that kind of thing like to pose as brave and responsible, they’re actually ducking the hard stuff — which is to say, being craven and irresponsible.\nWhich brings me back to the president’s new budget.\nIt goes without saying that Mr. Obama’s fiscal proposals, like everything he does, will be attacked by Republicans. He’s also, however, sure to face criticism from self-proclaimed centrists accusing him of irresponsibly abandoning the fight against long-term budget deficits.\nSo it’s important to understand who’s really irresponsible here.

What do you know about those?"", ""I can't wait for the Hyperloop to become a reality! It would be amazing to travel at such high speeds. But I'm a bit skeptical about the underground tunnel idea. Do you think it's practical?""]",,"['The construction of the Panama Canal has had a significant impact on global trade patterns by creating a crucial shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Prior to the canal’s completion in 1914, ships had to travel around the southern tip of South America, adding thousands of miles and weeks to the journey. This increased transportation costs and limited trade between east and west.\n\nAfter the canal’s construction, global trade patterns shifted dramatically. The canal reduced travel time and costs, leading to increased trade between the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Countries that were once isolated due to geographical barriers could now easily exchange goods and resources. As a result, the canal became a vital transportation hub that contributed to the growth of world trade and boosted global economic integration.\n\nThe construction of the canal also had a ripple effect on trade patterns far beyond the United States and Panama. Shipping routes between Asia and Europe, for example, were now shorter and more cost-effective, which led to the development of new trading partnerships and economic ties. The canal’s success also inspired the construction of similar shortcuts, such as the Suez Canal, which further facilitated trade between continents.\n\nOverall, the construction of the Panama Canal has had a significant impact on global trade patterns and has played a crucial role in the development of the global economy.', ""Yes, there have been recent developments and changes to the Panama Canal that have further affected global trade patterns. In June 2016, a $5.25 billion expansion project was completed that doubled the canal's capacity and allowed larger ships to pass through. Prior to the expansion, the canal could only accommodate ships with a maximum capacity of around 5,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units).\n\nThe expansion now allows much larger ships, such as those with a capacity of up to 14,000 TEUs, to pass through the canal. This has opened up new trade routes and allowed for larger volumes of goods to be transported between the Atlantic and Pacific regions. This has led to several changes in global trade patterns, such as an increase in shipping traffic and a shift in trade routes.\n\nThe expansion has also impacted the competition between ports, as some ports now face challenges in accommodating larger ships. This has prompted some ports to increase their capacity and improve infrastructure in order to remain competitive.\n\nMoreover, as global warming causes Arctic sea ice to melt faster than ever, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) will become accessible for longer, providing a shortcut from Europe to Asia. However, the NSR has limitations in terms of accessibility and infrastructure, making the Panama Canal expansion an even more crucial factor for world trade. \n\nOverall, the Panama Canal expansion has had a significant impact on global trade patterns by increasing capacity, facilitating larger ships and opening up new and improved trade routes for many countries."", ""Yes, there are several other similar projects in the works to further improve transportation and logistics around the world.\n\nOne of the most notable projects is the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project proposed by China to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of roads, railways, and ports. The initiative aims to enhance economic connectivity and promote trade by establishing new trade routes and improving existing ones, based on the old Silk Road.\n\nAnother notable project is the Trans-Siberian Railway, a railway network that spans the entire width of Russia, connecting Moscow to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. The railway facilitates transportation of goods between Europe and Asia, and has been adapted to handle container traffic more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, there are several high-speed rail projects underway around the world, including in China, Japan, and Europe, which aim to connect major cities and reduce travel time between them.\n\nThese projects highlight the continued importance of transportation infrastructure in facilitating global trade and economic growth. By providing faster and more efficient transportation options, they can help lower transportation costs, reduce delivery times, and increase the overall competitiveness of a country's economy."", 'Yes, Elon Musk has several transportation projects in the works, with the Hyperloop being one of the most notable ones. The Hyperloop is an ultra-high-speed transportation system that Musk proposed in 2013, which would transport passengers and cargo through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour.\n\nThe Hyperloop uses a system of electromagnetic propulsion to move the pods that transport passengers and cargo through the tubes. The idea behind the Hyperloop is to provide a faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient alternative to air travel or road transportation, and to reduce traffic congestion and transportation-related carbon emissions.\n\nSeveral companies are working on developing the Hyperloop, including Virgin Hyperloop, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, and Hardt Hyperloop. These companies are currently testing the technology and working on developing the infrastructure needed for the system to become a reality.\n\nIn addition to the Hyperloop, Musk is also working on developing reusable rockets for interplanetary space travel through his space exploration company, SpaceX. Musk has also proposed a concept called ""The Boring Company,"" which aims to reduce traffic congestion by building underground tunnels for transportation.\n\nOverall, Musk\'s transportation projects are ambitious and innovative, and could have a significant impact on global transportation and logistics if they are successfully developed and deployed.', ""The concept of The Boring Company, Elon Musk's underground tunneling project, is certainly ambitious and innovative. It aims to reduce traffic congestion and improve transportation speed by creating underground tunnels for transportation, which would allow for faster travel times and reduced traffic.\n\nHowever, the practicality of the idea is debatable. Creating a network of underground tunnels would require extensive excavation and construction work, and could be very costly and time-consuming. In addition, there are likely to be regulatory and technological challenges that would need to be overcome to make the tunnels safe and practical.\n\nFurthermore, there are questions about the long-term feasibility of the concept. Building a network of underground tunnels would require ongoing maintenance and repair work, and there may be unforeseen issues that arise with keeping the tunnels safe and functioning over the long term.\n\nDespite these challenges, The Boring Company has already made significant progress on the project and is actively working on developing the technology and infrastructure needed to make the tunnels a reality.

In radix sort, we sort the array by comparing the digits of the numbers from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). We start by sorting the numbers based on their rightmost (least significant) digit, then their second rightmost digit, and so on until we reach the leftmost (most significant) digit. This approach is called the LSD approach, as it starts at the least significant digit and works its way up to the most significant digit. The reason we use the LSD approach in radix sort is because it allows us to sort the numbers with linear time complexity. That is, we can sort the numbers in O(n) time per digit, since we only need to do a counting sort operation for each digit. By using the LSD approach and sorting the numbers one digit at a time, we avoid having to compare all the digits of each number at once, which would take much longer (O(n log n) time complexity).

They allow organizations to improve their productivity and enhance their services while engaging with customers in new and innovative ways. With the increasing dependency on software-based solutions, it is critical for businesses to prioritize the safety and reliability of their application delivery processes. This essay explores the significance of ensuring secure application delivery in contemporary businesses, the potential risks of unsecured applications, and the different strategies organizations can use to guarantee a safe and reliable software deployment.\n\nThe significance of application security cannot be overstated, especially with the rise of cyber threats such as malware, ransomware, and data breaches. Unsecured applications can provide entry points for malicious actors to gain access to sensitive business and customer data, resulting in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liability. In addition, flawed or malfunctioning applications can cause business disruptions, disrupt customer experiences, and lead to lost revenue. Therefore, every organization must be aware of the implications of insecure app delivery on customer trust, data confidentiality, and business operations.\n\nOne of the key strategies for ensuring secure application delivery is to conduct rigorous testing and assessment of applications before deployment. This includes vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code analysis to identify and remediate any potential security gaps. Application developers must also follow best practices for secure coding and incorporate security features like encryption and access controls to safeguard data and systems.\n\nAnother strategy for ensuring secure application delivery is to adopt a comprehensive risk management framework that aligns with business goals and objectives. This includes the implementation of security policies, procedures, and protocols that are regularly reviewed and updated to keep pace with evolving threats and changing business needs. Organizations must also ensure that they have the necessary resources, budgets, and trained personnel to manage and respond to security incidents.\n\nAdditionally, organizations should incorporate a security-focused culture across all levels of their business to foster a security-conscious workforce. This involves providing regular security training and awareness programs that educate employees on the risks of unsecured applications and the importance of adhering to security protocols. Employees must also be equipped with the necessary tools and technologies to secure their devices, networks, and applications.\n\nFinally, organizations must stay vigilant about emerging security threats and trends to adapt their security strategies accordingly. This requires continuous monitoring and analysis of security events and vulnerabilities to identify potential risks and respond promptly. By adopting a proactive, holistic approach to application security, organizations can minimize the risks of unsecured applications and ensure safe and reliable software deployment.\n\nIn conclusion, securing application delivery is critical for contemporary businesses to safeguard their data, maintain customer trust, and operate with efficiency. Organizations must adopt a comprehensive risk management framework, integrate security into their culture, and stay informed about the latest threats and trends to ensure secure application delivery. Failure to prioritize application security can expose businesses to significant risks and undermine their ability to succeed in today's digital landscape. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to prioritize application security and apply best practices to protect their business and customers."", ""Certainly! There have been several reported cases of companies facing significant consequences due to inadequately secured applications. For instance, in 2017, Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency, suffered a massive data breach that exposed sensitive personal information of approximately 147 million consumers. The breach was attributed to a vulnerability in a web application, which hackers exploited to gain unauthorized access to the company's systems. Equifax faced a severe backlash from the public and regulatory authorities, resulting in a $575 million settlement, reputational damage, and legal and compliance consequences.\n\nAnother example is the Target data breach that occurred in 2013, where hackers compromised the company's systems through a vulnerability in its payment system application. The breach resulted in stolen payment card data and personal information of approximately 110 million customers. Target faced significant financial losses, went through a costly legal process, and experienced substantial reputational damage, causing a decrease in sales and business value.\n\nIn 2018, Facebook suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 50 million users' accounts. The breach was attributed to a flaw in the application's access control mechanism that allowed hackers to steal Facebook access tokens. The consequences for Facebook included a loss of user trust, increased regulatory scrutiny, negative media coverage, and a drop in the company's market value.\n\nThese cases highlight the severe consequences of failing to prioritize application security, from financial losses to reputational damage, decreased consumer trust, and legal and compliance consequences."", ""Certainly! After their respective security breaches, Equifax, Target, and Facebook took several measures to address their security vulnerabilities and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. After the Equifax breach, the company established a dedicated website to offer free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to affected consumers. Additionally, Equifax implemented a multi-year technological and business transformation program to enhance its security posture, including investing in new data protection technologies and conducting regular security evaluations and penetration testing. Similarly, in response to the Target breach, the company implemented tighter security controls and protocols, including enhancing its system monitoring capabilities, restricting privileged access, and strengthening its payment system. Target also established a separate position of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to oversee and manage its cybersecurity operations and implemented more rigorous training for its employees. After the Facebook data breach, the company conducted a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the breach and the potential impact on its users. Facebook also alerted affected users, revoked the compromised access tokens, and implemented additional measures to protect the privacy and security of its users' data. Additionally, the company invested in strengthening its security mechanisms, including machine learning models for fraud detection, two-factor authentication for additional user protection, and regular security audits and testing. Overall, the response from these companies highlights the importance of addressing vulnerabilities promptly and robustly, investing in security measures, and maintaining a proactive cybersecurity posture to prevent future security incidents."", 'Certainly! Below are a few more examples of companies that have faced the consequences of unsecured applications.\n\nIn 2019, Capital One experienced a data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 100 million customers and applicants. The breach resulted from a misconfiguration of a firewall that allowed a hacker to access sensitive data stored in Capital One’s cloud environment. The company faced regulatory and legal consequences, reputational damage, and a hefty settlement of $80 million.\n\nIn 2018, Under Armour reported that approximately 150 million users of its MyFitnessPal application had their login data, usernames, and email addresses exposed. The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in the application, which allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. The company had to notify its customers, encourage them to change their passwords, and ultimately face reputational damage.\n\nIn 2020, security researchers discovered a vulnerability in the VPN application Pulse Secure, which allowed hackers to gain remote access to systems of companies using the application. The vulnerability affected several organizations, including multiple U.S. Government agencies. The consequences included unauthorized data access, potential espionage, reputational damage, and legal consequences.\n\nThese examples showcase the diverse range of organizations that can fall victim to unsecured applications, from small businesses to large, well-established organizations. As a small business owner, it is essential to understand the risks and take necessary measures to protect your business. This includes investing in robust security solutions, conducting regular security assessments, and keeping up-to-date with emerging threats and vulnerabilities. By prioritizing the security of your applications, you can safeguard your business from the negative consequences of insecure app delivery.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

The head of the family, Michael, was an alcoholic, and his addiction had driven a wedge between him and his wife, Sarah, and his children, Lucy and Marcus. Michael's drinking had escalated to a level where it had started to impact his job and his relationships with people, causing a rift between him and his family.\n\nLucy, 17, and Marcus, 15, had grown up seeing their father's addiction, and they had learned to cope with it in their way. Lucy had learned to be stoic, burying her emotions deep inside, while Marcus sought solace in his video games, often staying up until the wee hours of the morning. Sarah, on the other hand, had tried her best to keep the family together, but it was getting tough. She had to bear the brunt of Michael's anger and frustration every day, and she had no idea how to help him get better.\n\nAct 2\n\nOne day, Michael showed up at his family's doorstep, drunk and angry. He had lost his job, and he didn't know what to do. Sarah tried to talk to him, but he was too far-gone in his addiction. That was the last straw for Lucy, who had had enough of seeing her father's addiction destroying their family. She sought help from a therapist, who suggested that they join a support group for families dealing with addiction.\n\nAt first, it was tough for the Baxters to open up about their struggles, but eventually, they realized that they were not alone. There were other families grappling with addiction, and the support group helped them understand that addiction was a disease, and it could be treated. They also learned to communicate better as a family, and they started to see positive changes in their relationships.\n\nAct 3\n\nMichael's journey towards recovery was not easy. He had to admit that he had a problem and seek help. It was a humbling experience for him, but he knew that he had to change for his family's sake. He started attending AA meetings, therapy sessions, and rehab, which helped him understand the root cause of his addiction and how to cope with it. He also learned skills and tools that would help him stay sober.\n\nThe road towards recovery was a long and arduous one, but Michael had the support of his family every step of the way. Sarah had learned to forgive Michael for his past mistakes, and Lucy and Marcus were proud of their father for taking responsibility for his actions. The family had bonded over their shared experience, and they had become stronger as a unit.\n\nConclusion\n\nBreaking the chain of addiction was not easy, but the Baxters had done it. They had learned to communicate better, had sought professional help, and had supported each other throughout the process. Addiction was a part of their lives, but it didn't define them. They had come out on the other side, stronger and more resilient, and were hopeful for a better future."", ""Act 1\n\nThe Baxter family appeared to be a tight-knit family, but their secret of addiction had created a wedge between them.

To the outside world, they were a successful and happy family, but internally they were dealing with the challenges of addiction, which had led to resentment, frustration, and heartbreak.\n\nLucy, who was 17, began to struggle with alcohol and drug addiction as well. She had always seen her father's alcohol abuse and how he used it to escape from reality. It hadn't taken long for her to start to follow in his footsteps. Her addiction caused her to withdraw from her family, causing further strife and tension.\n\nMarcus, Michael, and Sarah found it difficult to deal with Lucy's addiction, as they felt helpless and didn't know how to help her. Sarah had her demons too, struggling with anxiety and depression. The addiction had made her feel even more anxious, and it was taking a toll on her mental health.\n\nAct 2\n\nOne day, Sarah suggested that they all attend counseling to help them understand the addiction and work together to overcome it. The therapist encouraged them to talk openly about their experiences and how they felt, creating an environment that was safe for them to express themselves.\n\nThrough counseling, they learned how important it is to not only identify the addiction but also recognize that it's a family disease that affects everyone. They began to understand how their individual experiences played a role in their addiction and how to communicate with one another better.\n\nMichael felt a sense of guilt for not being there for his family and not setting a positive example for his children. He wanted to make amends for his actions and be the father and husband his family needed. Lucy felt seen and heard, for once, and found comfort in the fact that she wasn't alone in her experience with addiction.\n\nAct 3\n\nThe family worked together to overcome their addiction, one day at a time. Michael continued with his AA meetings, group therapy, and rehabilitation, which helped him stay sober. It was tough, but the support of his loved ones kept him going.\n\nSarah started seeing a therapist that helped her deal with her anxiety and depression, teaching her coping mechanisms to help her stay centered. She also learned other healthy ways to manage stress, such as yoga, meditation, and exercise.\n\nLucy joined a support group for teens battling addiction and began to work on her addiction in a non-judgmental and supportive environment. She initially struggled with accepting her addiction, but through therapy, support from her family, and friends, she began to understand that her addiction does not define her. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe Baxter family's journey towards recovery was not easy, but it was necessary for them to heal as individuals and as a family. They recognized that their addiction was a part of them, but it did not need to define them. Through therapy, counseling, and support, they learned to communicate and work together to overcome their addiction. It was a challenging road, but with love, support, and professional help, they proved that recovery was possible. Their journey to recovery is ongoing, but they were hopeful for the future, for a life that is full of hope and love.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Be sure to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydroponics compared to traditional agriculture, as well as any current or future applications of hydroponics in food production. Use specific examples and research to support your argument. Additionally, make sure to address any potential criticisms or limitations of hydroponics as a sustainable food production method. Your writing should be clear, concise, and well-organized.', 'Can you add some details on the types of crops that can be grown using this method?', ""Could you please provide some examples of hydroponics being used in urban agriculture? I'm interested in learning more about how this method can be applied in city settings.""]",,"[""Hydroponics is an advanced modern agricultural method that allows farmers to grow crops without soil. This method uses water and nutrient solutions to maintain a plant's growth and development, allowing them to grow indoors or in greenhouses. Hydroponics has the potential to revolutionize sustainable food systems by offering numerous advantages over traditional agriculture, such as reducing water usage, land use, and environmental pollution, while improving crop yields, reducing crop loss, and increasing the nutritional value of produce. Additionally, hydroponics presents a new way to produce high-quality crops year-round, even in regions with unfavorable weather conditions.\n\nOne significant advantage of hydroponics is its ability to grow crops with significantly less water compared to traditional agriculture. In modern times, water is becoming scarce, causing concern that agriculture can consume up to 80% of the world's freshwater. Hydroponics is, therefore, seen as a solution to this issue since it can save up to 90% of water required for crop production. In traditional farming, water runs through the soil, carrying away essential nutrients, causing soil degradation and often leading to over-irrigation, which leads to erosion in nearby areas. Through hydroponic cultivation, water is re-circulated, reducing the amount of water lost.\n\nAnother advantage of hydroponics is that it can reduce the exposure of plants to pests and diseases. With hydroponics, plants can be grown in a controlled, sterile environment, reducing the risk of fungal infection, viruses, and bacteria. Hydroponic cultivation uses a nutrient-rich solution, making chemical pesticides and herbicides unnecessary. Hydroponics' closed system also ensures that there is no contamination of the environment with excess nutrients or chemicals, which can lead to ecological damage.\n\nOne more advantage of hydroponics is that it can reduce land use pressure. Hydroponics' nutrient-dense system uses less land than traditional farming since plant roots do not require a large area of soil to thrive. Additionally, hydroponic systems can be stacked vertically, reducing the amount of floor space required to grow food. This ability to grow food in multi-level greenhouses or in urban spaces has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about space utilization.\n\nDespite its several benefits, hydroponics also has some limitations, mainly in terms of its cost and energy requirements. Hydroponic systems' initial expenditure can be costly, with high upfront costs for equipment and infrastructure. Additionally, the cost of electricity needed to power hydroponic systems is higher than traditional farming's energy requirements, which may increase food prices unless energy-efficient hydroponic cultivation, such as solar energy, is developed. \n\nOne criticism of hydroponics is that it typically relies on synthetic nutrient solutions derived from chemicals. However, this is a challenge that can be addressed, with innovations that will ensure hydroponics relies on organic-based, environmentally friendly solutions.\n\nMoreover, hydroponics' reliance on complex systems runs the risk of being anti-organic, potentially excluding smaller, less technologically advanced farmers, who may not have the financial resources to invest in the required technology. These farmers may not be able to keep up with the investment and technical requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, hydroponics is an innovative and dynamic method of sustainable agriculture that has the potential to revolutionize the food system dynamically. This method is gaining traction globally due to its potentials for reduced water requirement, reduced land use, increased crop yields, and reduced environmental pollution. Despite the initial high costs, hydroponics offers an alternative to traditional agriculture, allowing for year-round high-quality crops, regardless of weather conditions. Therefore, hydroponics holds great promise for the future of food systems as long as it is redesigned to be inclusive and environmentally friendly."", 'Sure! Hydroponics is a versatile method of agriculture that can grow various types of crops, including leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, and herbs, flowers, and even cannabis. Some of the most popular crops grown using hydroponics are lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, peppers, cucumbers, and herbs such as basil and mint. Hydroponics is also used to grow exotic crops such as microgreens and edible flowers such as nasturtium, borage, and marigold. Microgreens are young herbs, vegetables, and legumes harvested less than 14 days after sprouting. These greens are packed with nutrients and high in antioxidants, making them a popular addition to salads, sandwiches, and smoothies. Edible flowers also have high nutritional value and are used in culinary preparations such as salads, cakes, and cocktails. In addition, hydroponics is also used to grow crops that are typically imported or difficult to cultivate in certain regions, such as tropical fruits like bananas or pineapples. The advantages of hydroponics, such as climate control and water management, make it possible to grow such crops in controlled environments, providing local access to fresh tropical produce, and reducing carbon emissions associated with importing these goods. Moreover, hydroponics has potential applications for space exploration and human colonization of other planets. It is an ideal cultivation technique for growing food in space, as it allows astronauts to grow fresh produce in zero-gravity environments without soil, reducing weight and saving space. This area of hydroponics is still primarily experimental but has the potential to become a necessary component of long-term space missions. Overall, hydroponics is a versatile method of agriculture that can grow a variety of crops, providing a more efficient and sustainable way to produce high-quality food.', ""Certainly! Hydroponics is an excellent technique for urban agriculture, where space is often at a premium. Many cities have established hydroponic systems in abandoned buildings, rooftops, or indoor spaces to grow fresh produce, creating green space and promoting healthier and more sustainable food sources in urban environments. Here are a few examples of hydroponics being used in urban agriculture: \n\n1. Gotham Greens: It is a hydroponic farm, which operates year-round in New York City. They use several rooftop greenhouses to cultivate various types of leafy greens, such as lettuce and herbs, using hydroponic techniques. They distribute their produce to grocery stores, farmers markets, and restaurants in the city. 2. The Plant: It is a vertical farm in Chicago that uses an innovative hydroponic system to grow fish, mushrooms, and vegetables. The Plant powers the farm by recycling waste from neighboring food businesses, making it a closed-loop, sustainable operation. 3. BrightFarms: It is a hydroponic farm that operates greenhouses in several cities, including New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. They use hydroponics to grow a variety of greens, including lettuce, herbs, and basil, which are sold to local grocery stores and food markets. 4. Farm.One: It is a hydroponic farm in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood that supplies locally grown fresh herbs and microgreens to high-end restaurants in the city. Farm.One uses several hydroponic grow towers in a small indoor space to grow different types of herbs, such as basil, mint, and chives. 5. Philadelphia Urban Creators: It is a community-based organization in Philadelphia that uses hydroponics to grow fresh produce and provide education on sustainable agriculture. They have built a hydroponic greenhouse where the community can grow vegetables and other crops for themselves and sell the excess produce to local food markets. These examples show how hydroponics can be used effectively in urban agriculture projects, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional produce farming that can help build stronger local food systems and communities. By reducing transportation costs and promoting local food sources, urban hydroponics can help cities become more self-sufficient and reduce their carbon footprint.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

Can seismometers detect earthquakes from anywhere in the world?"", ""Wow, that's really amazing how seismometers can detect earthquakes from all over the world! How long have scientists been using them to study earthquakes?""]",,"['Scientists detect earthquakes using seismometers, which are devices that measure the vibrations caused by an earthquake. Seismometers are usually buried underground or placed on the surface of the earth. When an earthquake occurs, it sends out seismic waves that are recorded by the seismometer.\n\nThe magnitude of an earthquake is determined based on the amount of energy released during the earthquake. This energy is measured using what is known as the Richter scale. The Richter scale ranges from 1 to 10 and each increase of one unit on the scale corresponds to a tenfold increase in seismic energy. Scientists also use other methods such as the moment magnitude scale and the Mercalli intensity scale to measure the size and impact of an earthquake.', ""Yes, seismometers can detect earthquakes from anywhere in the world. In fact, seismic waves can travel across the entire globe and be detected by seismometers on the opposite side of the earth. This is possible because seismic waves travel through the earth's interior, which consists of various layers of different densities and consistencies. As the waves travel through these layers, they get reflected and refracted, which allows them to travel large distances. Seismologists use networks of seismometers located around the world to accurately detect and locate earthquakes, and to study their properties and effects on the earth's crust."", ""Scientists have been using seismometers to study earthquakes for over a century. The first modern seismometer was developed in the late 19th century by John Milne, a British seismologist. Milne's seismometer used a pendulum and a paper drum to record the motion caused by an earthquake. This early design paved the way for more advanced seismometers that were developed in the following decades.\n\nSince the early 1900s, seismometers have been used to detect and study earthquakes around the world. In the early years, seismographs were primarily used to study earthquakes that occurred close to the instruments. However, as more seismometers were installed around the world, scientists were able to study earthquakes that occurred far away from the instruments. This led to a better understanding of the global distribution of earthquakes and the nature of seismic waves.\n\nToday, seismometers are used not only to study earthquakes but also to monitor ground motion related to other phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and nuclear explosions.""]",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

"['What are some recommendations for exercising effectively and safely in colder weather?: We know January is a big time for fitness (that’s why we’ve been talking all about fitness-related resolutions in the app!). But as the cold weather and darker, shorter days drag on, it can be really hard to stay motivated on a workout routine, especially if the cold weather is keeping you inside.\nNow, we love a good gym session here at Baby2Body and, as you can tell by the Fitness Studio, we’re also big fans of circuit workouts that you can do anywhere. While these indoor workouts are great for muscle toning and strength building, they can be a bit more limited on cardio work. Maybe you love to hit the treadmill or elliptical or stationary bike – and if that’s the case, more power to you mama! Keep at it.\nHowever, if you get bored of running in place day in and day out – yet you still want to keep up your cardiovascular fitness – then you’ve come to the right place. We’ve got our top recommendations for how to exercise effectively and safely in colder weather, so you can keep on running, walking, or biking to your heart’s content! Plus, that extra time outside time will give you much needed Vitamin D, which will make you feel that much better and is especially important in winter months when our levels of this vitamin naturally decrease.\nAlright – let’s get right to it!\nWhen we breathe cold air in through our mouth (as often the case while running), it can dry out and irritate mucous membranes in our airways, causing them to constrict and making it harder to breathe. This can, in turn, exacerbate exercise-induced asthma.\nHere’s what to do: If you’re running in cold temps it will help to wear a breathable neck warmer that you can use to cover your mouth as needed to warm and humidify the air you breathe.\nIf you do have asthma (not just exercise-induced asthma) it’s best to avoid exercising in very cold temps as it can further irritate symptoms.\nOur bodies are quite good at adapting to different temperatures. To maintain a body temp of about 37˚C (98.6˚F) our muscles rapidly contract in cold weather to stay warm (you’d call these ‘the chills’). Alternatively, our body cools off by producing sweat, which evaporates and effectively cools us. So, you want to find the balance of clothing that protects your skin from the cold, yet is also breathable enough to allow your body to naturally regulate its temperature.\nHeres what to do: There’s a theory called the “onion with 3 peels” that works for cold weather exercise attire.\nYour first peel should lay close to the body and be sweat-wicking, allowing for necessary evaporation.\nThe second peel is the thermal layer to provide insulation and additional warmth.\nYour third and final layer can be a windbreaker to cut back on wind chill.\nWhenever it’s cold out, the objective of the body is simple: protect the vital organs and direct heat towards them. Because of this, our arteries retract to reduce heat loss. As a result, our extremities (hands, feet, nose, ears) get less of that warming blood flow. If very cold exposure lasts for a long time, frostbite may occur.\nHere’s what to do: Stock up on quality cold weather running accessories!\nFor your nose – use your breathable neck warmer as needed!\nYou’ve certainly heard this a thousand times, but it’s because it’s so important: don’t skip the warm-up. A good warm-up is essential to avoid injury and have an effective workout. That’s especially true in the cold weather.\nHere’s what to do: If exercising outside this winter, it’s a good idea to double the amount of time you spend warming up. Before increasing the intensity on your workout you’ll want to make sure that your body feels warm and adjusted to the temperature and that your breathing has regulated.\nThis doesn’t mean skip your cool down! But, after you’ve crushed a cold-weather workout, it’s really important to recover properly. Unlike warmer weather workouts you won’t want to hang outside for your cool down because that post-run cold sweat is not fun and not the best for you.\nHere’s what to do: As soon as you’ve finished exercising, head inside, change out of your gear into something warm, dry and comfortable, and spend 5-10 minutes stretching all those muscles you just worked!\nFor more on how to thrive this time of year – check out this post on happiness hacks for the winter season.\nNext Post 9 Meals Under 550 Calories: HelloFresh Recipes Are Now On The Baby2Body App!', 'Can you recommend any specific brands or types of cold weather running accessories that would be good for protecting my extremities?', 'Can you suggest any tips for preventing frostbite during cold weather exercise?', 'Can you also recommend any cold weather running pants or tights that would be good for winter exercise?']",,"['1.

"['Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What are the potential obstacles that could prevent the Rangers from retaining defenseman Marc Staal beyond this season?\n\nPassage: At some point, Marc Staal will put pen to paper on a lucrative, long-term contract. It just remains to be seen if the Rangers will be the ones to pony up the dough.\nCould the 27-year-old defenseman be traded by the March 2 deadline? The Blueshirts know all too well how that works.\nStaal is in the final season of a five-year, $19.875 million extension that he signed back in September 2010. For the Rangers to retain Staal, they will likely need to offer him a deal exceeding the six-year, $32.5 million extension that teammate Dan Girardi signed in late February.\nGiven the willingness of NHL general managers to overpay established defenseman, Staal has every right to ask for a contract near $6 million per year for six years or more. This past summer, the Washington Capitals signed Brooks Oprik to a five-year, $27.5 million contract. At 34, Orpik is on the downside of his career and under contract until age 38.\nIf Orpik can earn a $5.5 annual average value contract in free agency, then Staal could certainly command offers near $6.5 million AAV should he hit the open market.\nDuring training camp, Staal said he wanted to avoid the prolonged negotiations that played out last season for Girardi, Henrik Lundqvist and former captain Ryan Callahan.\nSince making that statement, months have passed and there hasn’t been much to report.\nLast spring, Callahan’s demands paved the way to his departure from New York. General manager Glen Sather bristled at Callahan’s insistence of including a no-trade clause, and opted to ship his captain to the Tampa Bay Lightning for veteran winger Martin St. Louis.\nThe trade proved to be a masterstroke for the Rangers. Sather landed a surefire Hall of Famer and inspirational playoff performer. St. Louis played a major role in the Rangers’ run to the 2014 Stanley Cup Final, scoring three game-winning goals. The 39-year-old winger has 83 points in 88 career playoff games.\nThroughout his 14-year tenure as team president and GM, Sather has never been afraid to pull the trigger on an opinion-dividing trade. That was the case with the Callahan-St. Louis swap and also during the summer of 2010, when Sather sent popular Brandon Dubinsky and Artem Anisimov to Columbus to acquire goal-scoring ace Rick Nash.\nSo, what does the future hold for Staal?\nLately, Staal’s game-by-game performances have been full of peaks and valleys. He looked like an elite, shutdown defenseman during Tuesday’s 5-0 victory over the rival Pittsburgh Penguins, but against the Colorado on Thursday, he made two positional mistakes that lead to Avalanche goals.\nAdditionally, this is a player who has suffered multiple concussions and was told by doctors after taking a slap-shot to the right eye in March 2013 that his vision will never return to 100 percent. Some have argued that Staal’s long-term health is concerning and that his game is trending downward. He will turn 28 in January.\nThe thing to remember about Staal is although he tends to blow hot and cold during the regular season, he transforms into a beast during the playoffs. In recent postseasons, Staal has been instrumental in shutting down two of the game’s foremost superstars in Sidney Crosby of the Penguins and Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals.\nThroughout the 2014 Eastern Conference semifinals, Staal smothered and harassed Crosby. He was held to one goal and two assists as the Rangers eliminated the Penguins in seven games.\nSmooth-skating, 6-foot-4, 207-pound defensemen with a large reach do not grow on trees. Defensemen of Staal’s caliber rarely become available on the trade market – and when they do, it will cost an arm and a leg. It’s hard to imagine how the Rangers would go about replacing Staal if he were to leave via trade or free agency. His departure would create a crater-sized hole in their lineup.\nProspect Brady Skjei’s game has shares some similarities to a young Staal. The 20-year-old is currently enrolled in his junior year at the University of Minnesota. While there is reason for Rangers fans to feel upbeat about Skjei’s future, there’s no guarantee that he is the second coming of Staal.\nLike Lundqvist and St. Louis, Staal is an uncommon player whose value grows during the playoffs. The Rangers know what Staal’s all about. They understand what it will take to get a deal done. This time around, the Rangers should avoid any unnecessary drama by tying down Staal to a long-term extension months before the trade deadline.', 'Can you provide me with more details about the contract extension that Dan Girardi signed in late February?', 'Can you remind me of the potential offers that Marc Staal could command if he hits the open market?']",,"[""What is the potential obstacle to the Rangers retaining Marc Staal beyond this season? \n\nThe potential obstacle is the amount of money Staal may ask for in a long-term contract, as he is likely to ask for a deal exceeding the six-year, $32.5 million extension that teammate Dan Girardi signed in late February. Additionally, Staal's health is also a concern due to multiple concussions and a vision issue in his right eye. Finally, Staal's value grows during playoffs which may affect his potential contract offers should he hit the open market."", ""Dan Girardi signed a six-year, $32.5 million contract extension with the Rangers in late February. The deal included a no-movement clause in the first three years and a modified no-trade clause in the final three years. Girardi had been set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, but the Rangers signed him to a long-term deal to keep him in New York. Girardi had been a key part of the Rangers' defense for several seasons and was seen as a player who could continue to play at a high level for years to come."", 'If Marc Staal hits the open market, he could command offers near $6.5 million annual average value (AAV). This is based on recent NHL transactions where established defensemen have been overpaid. For example, the Washington Capitals signed Brooks Orpik to a five-year, $27.5 million contract at the age of 34, and he was on the downside of his career. If Orpik could earn a $5.5 million AAV contract, then Staal could certainly command higher offers based on his value and skill.']",,HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k

"Hi, can you tell me a story in a novel format including dialogs between the characters, a story based on the Justice League comics, including the characters, Green Arrow, Red Arrow and Cheshire. ASSISTANT: ",,"Once upon a time, in a world much like our own, a group of heroes banded together to protect the earth from the forces of evil. These heroes were known as the Justice League, and they were the finest and most powerful heroes the world had ever seen.

One day, the Justice League received a distress signal from a distant planet. They quickly set out to investigate and found a group of aliens under attack by a powerful villain known as Darkseid. The Justice League sprang into action and fought bravely against Darkseid and his minions.

During the battle, Green Arrow and Red Arrow worked together to take out several of Darkseid's soldiers. Red Arrow, a former member of the League, had returned to help his friends in their hour of need.

""Good to have you back, Roy,"" Green Arrow said as he fired his arrow at a group of approaching soldiers.

""Likewise, Ollie,"" Red Arrow replied as he nocked an arrow and let it fly.

The two archers worked together seamlessly, taking out enemy after enemy. But just as they were about to deliver the final blow to Darkseid, he unleashed a powerful blast of energy that knocked both archers off their feet.

As Green Arrow and Red Arrow lay injured on the ground, Cheshire appeared out of nowhere and sprang into action. A skilled and deadly fighter, Cheshire quickly took out several of Darkseid's soldiers and protected her injured friends.

""We've got to finish him off, Ollie,"" Red Arrow said as he struggled to sit up.

""I know,"" Green Arrow replied as he struggled to stand. ""But we can't do it alone. We need to call for backup.""

Cheshire nodded in agreement and the three heroes worked together to take down Darkseid and his minions once and for all.

In the end, the Justice League emerged victorious, and the earth was safe once again. Green Arrow, Red Arrow, and Cheshire had proven themselves to be a formidable team, and they knew that they could always count on each other to protect the world from the forces of evil.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

How can cryptocurrencies be improved and completely revamped/ ASSISTANT: ,,"1. Increase scalability: One of the biggest challenges facing cryptocurrencies is the limited throughput of the blockchain technology that underpins them. To address this challenge, developers need to create new technologies that increase the scalability of the system, such as sidechains, sharding, and Lightning Network. 

2. Improve privacy: Cryptocurrencies are not anonymous, and the transaction data is publicly available. To improve privacy, developers need to create new technologies that are designed to make transactions more secure and anonymous, such as ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs.

3. Increase usability: Cryptocurrencies are difficult to use for most people, and the user experience needs to be improved. Developers need to create new technology that makes it easier for people to use cryptocurrencies, such as simpler wallet interfaces and improved payment protocols.

4. Increase security: Cryptocurrencies are susceptible to hacks and thefts, and the security of the system needs to be improved. To increase security, developers need to create new technologies that make it harder for hackers to breach the system, such as multi-signature wallets and improved encryption protocols.

5. Implement better regulations: Cryptocurrencies are currently not regulated, and this has caused some problems.

How do I make escargot? ASSISTANT: ,,"Here are the steps to make escargot:

1. Obtain fresh snails. You can buy live snails from a fish market or online. Look for snails specifically sold as escargot, such as Helix pomatia. Rinse the snails thoroughly to remove any dirt or residue on the shells.

2. Purge the snails. Place the snails in a container with damp paper towels or a mesh bag for 3-5 days. This allows the snails to expel any toxins or impurities. Replace the damp paper towels daily.

3. Blanch the snails. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the snails and blanch for 1-2 minutes. Then remove and plunge in an ice bath. This kills the snails and allows you to remove them from their shells.

4. Remove the snails from their shells. Use a toothpick, snail fork, or tongs to extract the snail bodies from their shells. Rinse the snail meat under cold running water.

5. Make a garlic butter. Mix softened butter with minced garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper. You can also add lemon juice, white wine, or herbs like thyme.

6. Stuff the snail shells. Fill each snail shell with the garlic butter so it's about 2/3 full.

7. Bake the escargot. Place the stuffed shells on a baking sheet and bake at 400 F for 10-15 minutes until the butter is bubbly.

8. Serve. Serve the escargot immediately with bread to soak up the garlic butter. Provide small forks or snail tongs for extracting the snails. Enjoy your escargot!

9. Optional: garnish with parsley, paprika, or chopped garlic before serving. You can also grill the snails instead of baking for a smoky flavor. Bon appetit!",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval
How does metabolism work? ASSISTANT: ,,"Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical processes that occur within a living organism.

I want to start saving some money by growing my own food. Can I do this during the winter with an indoor garden? ASSISTANT: ,,"Yes, you can grow your own food indoors during the winter months. In fact, indoor gardening can be a great way to supplement your diet with fresh, homegrown produce even in the coldest climates. You can use a variety of containers, including wooden crates, buckets, and even old garbage cans, to create an indoor garden. Make sure to choose a container that is large enough for the plants to spread out and grow, but is also deep enough to accommodate a layer of soil. You should also use a high-quality potting soil or compost and add some additional fertilizer to the soil to give your plants the nutrients they need. To provide your plants with enough light, you can use special indoor grow lights or natural light from a south-facing window.

Ten European football teams – the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales – will participate in a season-long “OneLove” campaign promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination. ASSISTANT: ",,"As the new football season approached, tensions were high throughout Europe. The rise of hate crimes and discrimination had become a major concern, particularly in the world of sports. In response, ten of Europe's top football teams decided to come together to promote a message of inclusion and unity.

The ""OneLove"" campaign was born, with the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales all pledging their support. Each team committed to promoting the message of OneLove in their own unique way, using their platform to spread the word throughout the football community.

The Netherlands team, for example, decided to host a series of community events throughout the country, inviting fans of all backgrounds to come together and celebrate the diversity of their nation. The England team, meanwhile, worked with local schools to educate young people about the importance of inclusion and respect.

The Belgian team made a bold statement by unveiling a new rainbow-colored kit, symbolizing their commitment to promoting LGBTQ+ rights in the sport. The Danish team, on the other hand, used social media to share stories of players who had overcome discrimination and adversity, inspiring others to do the same.

As the season progressed, the OneLove campaign gained momentum, with more and more fans and clubs getting involved. The French team organized a tournament for underprivileged youth, providing opportunities for young people from all backgrounds to come together and play the sport they love.

The German team, meanwhile, partnered with local charities and organizations to raise awareness about the impact of discrimination on marginalized communities. The Norwegian team held a series of workshops and training sessions for coaches, helping them to create more inclusive and welcoming environments for young players.

The Swedish team, inspired by their country's tradition of social democracy, worked to promote equal access to football for all, regardless of income or social status. The Swiss team, meanwhile, focused on promoting gender equality in the sport, encouraging more women and girls to get involved in football at all levels.

And finally, the Welsh team used their platform to speak out against hate speech and online abuse, calling for a more positive and respectful online community for all football fans.

Thanks to the efforts of these ten teams, the OneLove campaign was a huge success, promoting a message of inclusion and unity that resonated throughout the football community and beyond.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film? ASSISTANT: ,,"There are a few reasons why watching episodic TV may feel less effortful than a film:

1. Familiarity. We are very used to watching TV shows in episodic format, with regular breaks. Our brains have become highly accustomed to this style of viewing. A continuous 2-3 hour film feels like more of an endurance test in comparison.

2. Built-in breaks. TV episodes have natural breaks built in after every 30 or 60 minutes. This gives our minds an opportunity to rest and reset. With a film, there are typically no breaks, so our attention has to be sustained for a longer continuous period.

3. Cliffhangers and anticipation. TV episodes often end on cliffhangers or unresolved story points that make us anticipate the next episode. This anticipation motivates us to keep watching, even if we're getting mentally fatigued. Films typically wrap up the full story, so there's less motivation to push through fatigue. 

4. Familiar characters and settings. We become very familiar with characters, settings, and story elements in TV shows over many episodes. This familiarity is comfortable and undemanding for our minds. Films have to introduce all new characters and settings in a short amount of time, requiring more mental effort to keep up.

5. Slower pace. TV shows generally have a slower pace of development, as they are meant to unfold over many episodes. This slower pace requires less intense focus and attention. Films have to deliver a full story in a short time, so the pace is usually much faster, demanding more concentration.

In summary, episodic TV feels less effortful thanks to familiarity, built-in breaks, cliffhangers, familiar characters, and a slower pace. Our minds can more leisurely enjoy TV shows, while films feel like more of an endurance test.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"As a space colonist on Mars, describe your daily life and the challenges you face living on another planet. ASSISTANT: ",,"As a helpful assistant, I am not a space colonist; however, I can provide you with a detailed description of what a day in the life of a space colonist on Mars might look like.

Morning:

A space colonist's day on Mars would typically begin with waking up in their compact living quarters within a Martian habitat. After getting up from their sleeping pod, they would perform their morning hygiene routine using minimal water and specialized toiletries designed for water conservation. Breakfast would consist of pre-packaged or freeze-dried meals that are easy to prepare and consume in the low gravity environment.

Communication:

Before starting their workday, the colonist would check in with Earth and fellow colonists for updates, progress reports, and any new instructions. This communication would be subject to a delay of up to 24 minutes due to the distance between Earth and Mars.

Work:

Daily work activities would vary depending on the colonist's role and expertise. Tasks may include maintaining and repairing equipment, conducting scientific research, monitoring life support systems, or exploring the Martian surface in search of resources and potential settlement sites. Space colonists would need to wear protective suits when venturing outside the habitat to protect them from the harsh Martian environment, including extreme temperatures, low air pressure, and radiation exposure.

Physical Exercise:

To counteract the effects of low gravity on muscle and bone strength, the colonist would engage in daily physical exercise using specialized equipment. This would help maintain their physical well-being and prevent potential health issues.

Lunch and Afternoon Activities:

Lunch would be another pre-packaged or freeze-dried meal, followed by continued work or research activities. Space colonists may also participate in virtual training and educational sessions to keep their skills sharp and stay informed about new developments in space exploration.

Evening:

As the Martian day, called a ""sol,"" comes to an end, colonists would prepare dinner, again using pre-packaged or freeze-dried food options. They would then have some time for leisure activities such as watching movies, reading, or playing games with fellow colonists. Social interaction is crucial for maintaining mental health and a sense of community in the isolated environment of Mars.

Night:

Before going to bed, colonists would perform maintenance checks on their living quarters and equipment, ensuring everything is in working order. They would then retire to their sleeping pods for a well-deserved rest, preparing for another day on Mars.

Challenges:

Living on Mars poses several challenges, including:

1. Limited resources, such as water, food, and energy, which need to be carefully managed and recycled.
2. The psychological impact of isolation and confinement in a small living space, far from Earth and loved ones.
3. Exposure to harmful radiation and the potential health risks associated with long-term space travel and living in low gravity environments.
4. The need for constant vigilance and maintenance of life support systems, equipment, and habitats to ensure the safety and survival of the colonists.
5. Adapting to the Martian environment, including extreme temperatures, dust storms, and the thin atmosphere, which makes activities like breathing and growing crops more challenging.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

What is kevlar made out of? ASSISTANT: ,,"Kevlar is made from poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide, which is an aromatic polyamide. It is a synthetic fiber material with a very high tensile strength-to-weight ratio. Kevlar was developed by DuPont and introduced in 1971. It is typically produced as a fiber, which is then used to make various materials and fabrics.

The key properties of Kevlar are:

• High tensile strength - Kevlar is 5 times stronger than steel on an equal weight basis.

• Lightweight - Kevlar is lightweight compared to other high-strength fibers.

• Cut resistant - Kevlar is very difficult to cut with a knife.

• Heat resistant - Kevlar maintains its properties in high heat environments up to 500°C.

• Chemically resistant - Kevlar is resistant to damage from most chemicals and solvents.

• Flexible - Kevlar can be manufactured as a woven fabric that retains flexibility.

• Non-conductive - Kevlar does not conduct electricity.

Kevlar has many applications such as protective gear like bulletproof vests, cut-resistant gloves, fiber-optic cables, brake pads, vehicle armor, helmets, etc. So in summary, the key ingredients are the aromatic polyamide molecules that give Kevlar its high strength and special properties.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"Given two matrices A and B which you can multiply together, does (A B)^T = A^T B^T or B^T A^T? ASSISTANT: ",,"For matrix multiplication, (A*B)^T = B^T * A^T, not A^T * B^T.

This is because matrix multiplication is not commutative - the order of multiplication matters.
When you take the transpose of a matrix product, you need to reverse the order of multiplication to get the correct result.

So if:
A = [[1, 2], 
     [3, 4]]

and 

B = [[5, 6],
     [7, 8]]

Then:
A * B = [[19, 22], 
           [43, 50]]

(A * B)^T = B^T * A^T = [[5, 7], 
                          [6, 8]] * [[1, 3], 
                                       [2, 4]] = [[19, 43], 
                                                  [22, 50]]

But: 
A^T * B^T = [[1, 3], 
               [2, 4]] * [[5, 6], 
                          [7, 8]] = [[17, 39], 
                                     [23, 51]] 

Which is not the same as (A * B)^T.

So in summary, for any matrices A and B, (A*B)^T = B^T*A^T, not A^T*B^T.  The order of multiplication is reversed when transposing a matrix product.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

what is the Infinite banking concept? ASSISTANT: ,,"The Infinite Banking Concept is a financial strategy that involves using a fixed-rate, single-premium life insurance policy as a financial tool for saving and borrowing money. The concept is based on the idea that the cash value of the life insurance policy can be accessed and borrowed against, similar to a bank account, without affecting the death benefit of the policy.

Here's how it works: An individual purchases a fixed-rate, single-premium life insurance policy and makes regular contributions to the cash value of the policy. The cash value accumulates over time, and the policyholder can access and borrow against it using a variety of financial strategies.

One common strategy is to use the cash value as collateral for a loan from a bank or other lending institution. The policyholder can then use the loan proceeds for any purpose, such as funding a business venture, paying for a wedding or a child's education, or making a down payment on a home.

Proponents of the Infinite Banking Concept argue that it can be a powerful financial tool for building wealth, providing access to low-cost financing, and creating a legacy for future generations. However, it's important to note that the Infinite Banking Concept may not be suitable for everyone, and individuals should carefully consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before implementing this strategy.

It's also important to note that the cash value of a life insurance policy may be subject to taxes and may affect the policy's death benefit. Additionally, there may be fees and charges associated with accessing the cash value of the policy, and the policyholder may need to repay the loan with interest if they are unable to keep up with the payments. As with any financial strategy, it's important to fully understand the risks and benefits before making a decision.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge ASSISTANT: ,,"Instance segmentation AP (Average Precision) metrics can be improved with human knowledge by following these steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by standardizing image size, removing noise, and augmenting the data. This allows the model to focus on the important features and helps to generalize better.

2. Data labeling: Manually annotate the images to create accurate ground truth labels. This can be done by drawing bounding boxes and masks for each object instance. Human knowledge plays a crucial role in accurate labeling, ensuring the model learns the correct features.

3. Train-test split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the test set includes a diverse range of object instances for accurate evaluation.

4. Model selection and fine-tuning: Choose a suitable model architecture like Mask R-CNN, PANet, or YOLACT, and fine-tune the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers. Human expertise can help in selecting the most appropriate model and hyperparameters for the task.

5. Transfer learning: Utilize pre-trained models to take advantage of the knowledge learned from similar tasks. This can speed up the training process and improve the model's performance.

6. Regularization: Add regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

7. Loss function: Choose an appropriate loss function that balances segmentation and classification tasks. Human knowledge can help in selecting a suitable loss function that addresses the specific requirements of the task.

8. Model evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test set using multiple metrics like AP@0.5, AP@0.75, and AP@[0.5:0.95], as well as visual inspection of the segmented instances. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

9. Iterative improvement: Based on the evaluation results, identify areas of improvement and iteratively refine the model, the dataset, or the training process. Human knowledge is essential in understanding the shortcomings and making necessary changes.

10. Active learning: Incorporate active learning techniques, where the model suggests samples that are difficult to segment, and a human annotator provides the correct labels. This helps in improving the model performance in challenging cases.

By incorporating human knowledge in these steps, you can enhance the instance segmentation AP metrics and achieve better results.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python. ASSISTANT: ,,"In Python, both sets and lists are used to store collections of elements, but they have some differences.

A list is an ordered collection of elements that can be of any data type. Lists are mutable, which means that you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list. Lists are created using square brackets [] and elements are separated by commas.

For example:

```
my_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
```

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements that can be of any data type. Sets are mutable, which means that you can add or remove elements from a set, but you cannot modify elements in a set. Sets are created using curly braces {} or the `set()` function.

For example:

```
my_set = {1, 'hello', 3.14, True}
```

The key difference between lists and sets is that lists are ordered and can contain duplicates, while sets are unordered and contain only unique elements.

This idea is difficult to accept and can seem downright bizarre.

1. Open the pull request that has the merge conflict. You'll see a message that there were merge conflicts that must be resolved.

2. Click the ""Resolve conflicts"" button to open the file with conflicts. The conflicts will be marked with >>>>>>> and <<<<<<<. 

3. Review the changes made by the ""HEAD"" commit (your branch) and the ""BASE"" commit (the target branch you're merging into). The sections marked with >>>>>>> are from HEAD and <<<<<<< are from BASE.

4. Edit the file to resolve the conflicts by either choosing one version or combining them. Remove the >>>>>>> and <<<<<<< markers. 

5. Add and commit the resolved file with a message like ""Resolve merge conflicts"". This will add the resolved file to the HEAD branch.

6. Check the ""Resolve conflicts"" button again. If there are more files with conflicts, repeat steps 2 through 5 to resolve those. 

7. Once all conflicts have been resolved, you can click ""Commit merge"" to complete the merge. 

8. On the pull request page, you'll see a ""Merged"" message with the commit SHA of the merged HEAD branch. Your pull request has been merged!

9. To sync the changes to your local repository, you'll need to fetch and merge the target branch. For example, if merging to master, you'd run:

```git fetch origin
git checkout master 
git merge origin/master
```

10. Resolve any final merge conflicts on your local files and commit. Your local repository is now up to date!

How can observing the behavior of other people in a social situation provide clues about cultural norms and expectations? ASSISTANT: ,,"Observing the behavior of other people in a social situation can provide clues about cultural norms and expectations in several ways:

1. Body language: People's body language, such as gestures, facial expressions, and posture, can reveal cultural norms about personal space, politeness, and acceptable ways to express emotions. For example, in some cultures, direct eye contact may be considered a sign of respect, while in others, it might be seen as confrontational.

2. Interactions: Watching how people interact with each other can provide insights into social roles, hierarchy, and communication styles. For instance, observing who initiates conversation, who interrupts, and who defers to others can reveal cultural expectations about gender roles, age, and status.

3. Dress and appearance: People's clothing, accessories, and grooming habits can convey cultural norms about modesty, formality, and self-expression. Observing how people dress for different occasions and how they react to others' appearance can provide clues about what is considered appropriate or fashionable in that culture.

4. Etiquette: Observing table manners, greetings, and other forms of etiquette can show cultural norms regarding politeness, hospitality, and social rituals. For example, in some cultures, it is customary to bring a gift when visiting someone's home, while in others, this might be seen as unnecessary or even inappropriate.

5. Language and communication: Listening to the language people use, their tone of voice, and their conversational patterns can reveal cultural norms about politeness, formality, and acceptable topics of conversation. For example, some cultures may value directness and assertiveness, while others may prefer more indirect and diplomatic communication styles.

6. Rituals and traditions: Observing cultural rituals and traditions, such as religious ceremonies, holiday celebrations, and rites of passage, can provide insights into a culture's values, beliefs, and social norms.

7. Group dynamics: Watching how people form and maintain social bonds, such as through shared activities, group affiliations, and expressions of loyalty or solidarity, can reveal cultural norms about social networks, trust, and community involvement.

By paying attention to these aspects of social behavior, one can gain a deeper understanding of cultural norms and expectations, which can be helpful for navigating new social environments, building rapport with people from diverse backgrounds, and avoiding misunderstandings or unintentional offenses.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract? ASSISTANT: ",,"It is generally a good idea to have a separate smart contract for any private sales or presales of tokens, as this allows you to keep the details of those sales separate from the main contract for the token launch. This can be helpful for a number of reasons, including the fact that it allows you to control access to the private sale contract more easily, and it can also help to prevent any confusion or issues that might arise from mixing the private sales with the main token launch.

To create a separate contract for the private sale of tokens, you can simply create a new smart contract file and deploy it to the blockchain, using a unique contract address for the private sale contract. You can then use this contract to manage the private sales of tokens, including setting up the terms and conditions of the sale, such as the token price, the number of tokens available for sale, and any other relevant details.

Once the private sales are complete, you can then use the main contract for the token launch to handle the distribution of tokens to investors and other users. This can be done by calling functions on the private sale contract to transfer the tokens from the contract to the main contract, and then using the main contract to distribute the tokens as needed.

Overall, having a separate contract for private sales can be a good way to manage the process of selling tokens privately to early investors, and it can help to ensure that the main contract for the token launch remains focused on the core functionality needed for the public launch of the token.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

Here is a recipe for making Kubdari:

Ingredients:

    1 1/2 cups flour
    2 eggs
    1/4 cup water
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/4 teaspoon baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon sugar
    1/4 cup cold butter, diced
    1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves (optional)
    1 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder or leg, diced
    1 large onion, diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tablespoon tomato paste
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    1 teaspoon ground coriander
    1 teaspoon dried marjoram or oregano
    1 teaspoon ground black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
    1/4 cup water
    1 egg, lightly beaten

Instructions:

    To make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, water, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Add the butter and work it into the flour mixture using your fingers or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

    To make the filling: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add the lamb and cook until browned, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.

    Add the onion, garlic, and tomato paste to the skillet and cook for another 2 minutes.

    Stir in the spices (cumin, coriander, marjoram, pepper, cinnamon, cloves) and cook for another 2 minutes.

    Pour in the water and simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the filling is dry, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.

    To assemble the Kubdari: Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into circles using a cup or biscuit cutter.

    Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center of each circle. Brush the edges of the circle with water.

    Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal.

    Use a fork to crimp the edges of the dough for a decorative look.

    Place the Kubdari on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops of the Kubdari with the egg wash.

    Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.

    Serve warm and enjoy!

Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth? ASSISTANT: ",,"Twitch recommends a minimum upload speed of 3000 kbps (kilobits per second) to stream at 720p 30fps. However, you may need more than this to maintain a smooth stream and online gameplay.

The bandwidth required for streaming depends on several factors, including the complexity of the game, the bitrate of the video encoding, and the amount of network overhead. To ensure a smooth streaming experience, you should aim for a bitrate that is higher than the minimum recommended by Twitch.

A good rule of thumb is to aim for a bitrate that is twice the recommended speed. So, for a 720p 30fps stream, you may want to aim for a upload speed of around 6000 kbps. This will provide enough headroom to handle any unexpected network issues and maintain a smooth stream and online gameplay.

It's also important to note that your download speed should be fast enough to handle the streaming and gameplay. Twitch recommends a minimum download speed of 5000 kbps for 720p 30fps streaming.

Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems? ASSISTANT: ,,"Using a symmetric probability distribution when modeling problems can lead to several issues, including:

1. Inaccurate representation of reality: Many real-world phenomena are not symmetric and exhibit skewed behavior. Using a symmetric probability distribution may oversimplify the problem and lead to incorrect or unrealistic conclusions.

2. Underestimation of tail risks: Symmetric distributions often have thinner tails than their asymmetric counterparts, which means they might underestimate the probability of extreme events occurring. This can cause decision-makers to be underprepared for such events.

3. Insensitivity to changes in skewness: If the underlying process has some degree of skewness, then using a symmetric distribution will not capture this information. As a result, the model may not be sensitive to changes in skewness, affecting the accuracy of predictions.

4. Ignoring directional trends: By assuming symmetry, a symmetric probability distribution does not account for directional trends in the data. This may lead to erroneous forecasts or predictions, especially in cases where there is a clear trend or momentum.

5. Overemphasis on central tendencies: Symmetric distributions focus on the mean and median as measures of central tendency. However, in some situations, the mode or other measures might be more relevant, and relying on a symmetric distribution can lead to misleading conclusions.

6. Inappropriate for categorical data: Symmetric probability distributions are generally designed for continuous data. When dealing with categorical or discrete data, using a symmetric distribution may be inappropriate and could lead to inaccurate results.

7. Limited applicability for asymmetric processes: Some processes, such as financial market returns or certain biological processes, have inherently asymmetric behavior. Using a symmetric distribution in these cases may lead to a poor fit and decreased predictive accuracy.

To overcome these issues, it is essential to choose an appropriate probability distribution based on the characteristics of the problem at hand, considering factors such as skewness, kurtosis, and the nature of the data.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge ASSISTANT: ,,"Instance segmentation is a task in computer vision that involves identifying and segmenting the instances of objects in an image or a video. It is a challenging task because it requires the model to not only identify the objects but also to distinguish between different instances of the same object.

There are several ways in which human knowledge can be used to improve instance segmentation AP metrics:

1. Data annotation: Human annotation of data is critical for training instance segmentation models. The annotation process involves identifying the objects in the image and segmenting them into individual instances. Human annotation ensures that the data is accurately labeled, which is essential for training a model that can generalize well to new images.
2. Model design: Human knowledge can be used to design the architecture of the instance segmentation model. For example, the model can be designed to incorporate spatial and temporal information, which can improve its ability to identify and segment instances of objects.
3. Post-processing: Human knowledge can be used to post-process the output of the instance segmentation model. For example, the model's output can be refined by removing false positives or by merging instances that are too close together.
4. Domain-specific knowledge: Human knowledge can also be used to improve the performance of instance segmentation models in specific domains. For example, domain-specific knowledge can be used to design models that are optimized for a particular type of object or scene.

Overall, the use of human knowledge can significantly improve the performance of instance segmentation models and help them achieve state-of-the-art results.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

How can I develop my critical thinking skills? ASSISTANT: ,,"Developing critical thinking skills involves practice and effort. First, it is important to identify and challenge your own assumptions and biases. This can be done by actively seeking out information that challenges your own beliefs and preconceived notions. Additionally, it is important to practice active listening and to be open-minded when encountering new ideas and perspectives. 

It is also important to learn how to analyze information, arguments, and problems from multiple perspectives. This can be done by reading and studying a wide variety of materials, including opposing viewpoints, and by actively engaging in conversations with people from different backgrounds. Additionally, it is important to learn how to identify the underlying causes of problems and to consider the consequences of potential solutions. 

Finally, developing critical thinking skills involves practicing the habit of questioning. It is important to ask questions and to challenge the status quo. By doing so, you will hone your ability to think critically and draw conclusions from available information.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

When should the above medication be switched to insulin due to CKD?<br> ASSISTANT: ",,"Based on the information provided, the current medication regimen appears to be appropriate for managing the patient's diabetes and CKD. However, it may be beneficial to consider adding an ACE inhibitor or ARB to help manage the patient's proteinuria and potentially slow the progression of their CKD. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing constipation may also be helpful in managing their conditions.

As for switching to insulin, this decision should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider. In general, insulin therapy may be necessary when oral medications are no longer effective at controlling blood sugar levels.

In terms of additional exams, regular monitoring of kidney function (such as blood tests to assess creatinine and GFR) and urine protein levels is recommended to track the progression of CKD. The patient may also benefit from regular eye exams to check for diabetic retinopathy and foot exams to monitor for neuropathy and other complications.

"Write an interesting and detailed backstory for my half-elf ranger character for Pathfinder. The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like ""raiders attacked the village"". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative. ASSISTANT: ",,"My character’s story begins in a small elven village nestled deep within a magical forest. This village was home to a small number of elves living in harmony with nature, peacefully tending to the land and living in harmony with one another. My character was born to an elven mother and a human father, which marked her as a half-elf. This caused some resentment from the other villagers, as she was seen as an outsider.

Despite the animosity, my character quickly proved herself to be a capable and fiercely loyal protector of the village. She was an expert tracker and woodsman, able to traverse the forest with ease and spot danger long before it reached the village. As she grew older, she spent more and more time outside the village, learning the secrets of the forest and honing her skills as a ranger.

One day, while exploring the forest, my character stumbled upon a strange, ancient temple hidden deep in the woods. She cautiously entered the temple and discovered it was a shrine to an ancient elven god. While exploring the temple, she was overcome by a strange power emanating from the shrine. When she awoke, my character found she had been blessed by the god with supernatural abilities.

With these newfound powers, my character vowed to protect her village from the dangers of the forest. She quickly became a master of the wilds, able to track and hunt down any creature that threatened her home. Her loyalty was unmatched, and she became a powerful force for good in the forest.

But it was not meant to last. One night, my character was out hunting when she stumbled upon a group of bandits intent on raiding her village. She fought bravely, but was eventually overcome by their numbers. The raiders sacked the village, killing or enslaving its inhabitants. My character managed to escape, but the trauma of that night has stayed with her ever since.

Now, my character is a loner, wandering the forests in search of justice and vengeance. She is a force for good, using her powers and skills to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who have wronged her. Her story is one of tragedy, but also of courage and determination. She may never be able to return home, but she will never forget the village that she once called home.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

• Offer an incentive for people to sign up, like a discount, free trial, or early access. This makes people more eager to get on the waitlist.

• Promote your waitlist on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Run ads to boost visibility.

• Reach out to influencers and media outlets in your industry to help spread the word about your upcoming launch. Ask them to promote your waitlist to their audiences.

• Build buzz by releasing details about your product or service incrementally. For example, release screenshots, demos, or teasers to keep people engaged while they wait.

• Send regular updates to people on your waitlist to keep them in the loop on your progress. But don't overload them with emails.

• Offer a referral program where people get a reward for referring others to join the waitlist. This can help you gain more signups.

• Make sure your waitlist signup process is simple and easy to complete. Ask for essential information only like name and email address.

• Launch to people on your waitlist first before opening up to the general public. This rewards them for their patience and loyalty.

• Continue engaging with those on your waitlist even after launch. Turn them into your first customers and advocates.

• Learn from your waitlist process to improve how you build buzz and anticipation for future products and services. Track key metrics like signup rates and referrals.

"How many balloons would it take to lift a house like in the movie ""Up""? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step. ASSISTANT: ",,"Here is my step-by-step reasoning for how many balloons it would take to lift a house:

1. First, we need to make some assumptions about the size and weight of the house. Let's assume a two-story house that is 30 feet by 40 feet, with standard 8-foot ceiling heights, so the total volume is around 24,000 cubic feet. If the house is made of typical wood frame construction with drywall and roofing materials, it would weigh around 50-100 pounds per cubic foot. So let's estimate the total weight of the house at around 2 million pounds or 1,000 tons.

2. Helium balloons can generate about 0.5 pounds of lift for every cubic foot of helium. So to lift 2 million pounds, we would need 4 million cubic feet of helium. Since a typical helium balloon holds about 5,000 to 10,000 cubic feet of helium, that would require 400 to 800 large helium balloons. 

3. However, the balloons would also have to lift the weight of the balloons themselves and the ropes/harnesses attaching them to the house. The balloons weigh a few pounds each, so 400-800 balloons could weigh 1,500 to 4,000 pounds total. The ropes and harnesses would likely weigh a few thousand pounds more. So we need to add at least 5,000-10,000 more pounds of lift to account for these additional weights.

4. Adding this additional weight, a reasonable final estimate would be that it would take around 500 to 1,000 large helium balloons, each able to generate 5,000 to 10,000 cubic feet of lift, to lift a typical two-story house off the ground in the manner portrayed in the movie ""Up."" Of course, this doesn't even begin to consider the logistical challenges of attaching that many balloons to a house! But in theory, with enough balloons and the right equipment, it is physically possible based on the lifting power of helium balloons.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"Verify the correctness of the given statement.

""For all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then jk is odd."" ASSISTANT: ",,"This statement is correct. 

To prove it, we can use the definition of an odd number: an integer is odd if and only if it can be expressed as 2n + 1 for some integer n. 

Suppose j and k are odd integers, then we can write j = 2n1 + 1 and k = 2n2 + 1 for some integers n1 and n2. 

Multiplying j and k, we get:

jk = (2n1 + 1)(2n2 + 1) 

Expanding this product, we get:

jk = 4n1n2 + 2n1 + 2n2 + 1 

We can rewrite this expression as:

jk = 2(2n1n2 + n1 + n2) + 1 

Since 2n1n2 + n1 + n2 is an integer, we see that jk can be expressed in the form 2n + 1, which is the definition of an odd number. Therefore, jk is odd.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.

"To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.
 ASSISTANT: ",,"Yes, a double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window and a single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window. 

For a double pane window to be more efficient than a triple pane window, it depends on the U-value and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) of the window. The U-value is a measure of the rate at which heat flows through the window and the lower the U-value, the better the window's insulation. The SHGC is a measure of how much solar radiation passes through the window and the lower the SHGC, the less solar heat comes in. 

If the U-value and SHGC of a double pane window are lower than that of a triple pane window, then the double pane window would be more efficient. This is because the number of panes alone does not determine the efficiency of the window. 

Similarly, for a single pane window to be more efficient than a double pane window, a low-e coating can be added to the single pane window. A low-e coating is a thin layer of material that reflects infrared radiation, which reduces the amount of heat that passes through the window. 

For example, let's consider two windows: a triple pane window with a U-value of 0.2 and SHGC of 0.4, and a double pane window with a U-value of 0.15 and SHGC of 0.3. In this case, the double pane window would be more efficient because it has a lower U-value and SHGC, even though it has fewer panes.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

explain what the theory of sexual selection is and give an example. ASSISTANT: ,,"The theory of sexual selection is the idea that certain traits evolve specifically because they are attractive to the opposite sex. These traits may provide no survival advantage and can even be detrimental to survival, but because they increase an individual's reproductive success, they persist in a population.

A classic example of sexual selection is the peacock's tail. The peacock's colorful and elaborate tail feathers make it more visible to predators and also require a lot of energy to grow and maintain. However, peahens (female peafowl) prefer to mate with males that have the most impressive tail display. So, over many generations, the peacock tail has become more and more elaborate and flashy through female mate choice. Even though the tail is detrimental to the male's survival, it is advantageous for reproduction. This is a prime example of how sexual selection can drive the evolution of conspicuous traits that increase mating success.

Other examples of sexual selection include:

• Bright coloration and complex songs in many birds, frogs, and insects that attract mates

• Large antlers in deer and elk, which are used to compete for access to females

• Complex courtship behaviors, like mating dances, that are meant to impress the opposite sex

• Ornamentation and bright coloration in many fish, like the betas, that help attract mates

• Large body size in some species, like elephant seals, that gives males a competitive advantage in fighting for mates

So in summary, sexual selection leads to the evolution of traits that increase the mating success of individuals, even at the expense of survival. These traits are advantageous for reproduction, if not for survival.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"Could you provide a brief summary of the book ""Fooled by Randomness"", by Nassim Nicholas Taleb? Please provide a few paragraphs with the summary and the main points discussed in the book. 
How well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there? ASSISTANT: ",,"""Fooled by Randomness"" is a book written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, published in 2001. The main topic of the book is the idea that randomness and probability play a much larger role in our lives than we tend to acknowledge. The title of the book is a reference to the idea that we often mistake random events for non-random events, and that we are fooled by the illusion of understanding and control.

Taleb argues that we tend to overestimate our ability to predict and control the outcomes of events, particularly in the financial markets. He suggests that many of the investment strategies that are popular among professionals and amateurs alike are based on flawed assumptions about the way the world works. He also argues that many of the successes that we attribute to skill or intelligence are actually the result of random chance.

One of the key points of the book is the idea of ""antifragility."" Taleb argues that some systems and structures are able to benefit from shocks and stress, and that these are the ones that are truly robust and resilient. He suggests that we should focus on building antifragile systems rather than simply trying to prevent failures.

Overall, ""Fooled by Randomness"" has been well-received by readers and critics. It has been praised for its insights into the nature of randomness and probability, and for its challenge to conventional wisdom in the financial world. However, some critics have argued that Taleb's ideas are overly simplistic and that his arguments are not always well-supported.

In conclusion, ""Fooled by Randomness"" is a thought-provoking book that challenges us to think more deeply about the role of randomness and probability in our lives. It is a valuable read for anyone interested in finance, risk management, or decision-making.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? ASSISTANT: ",,"Vaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a virus or bacterium into the body. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies to fight off the invader. If the person is later exposed to the actual virus or bacterium, their immune system recognizes it and can fight it off more easily, preventing the person from getting sick or reducing the severity of the illness.

Herd immunity is the protection of a whole community from infectious diseases because enough people in the community are vaccinated and immune to the disease. When a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, even those who cannot receive the vaccine due to medical reasons or other factors are protected because the spread of the disease is limited. This is because the virus or bacterium cannot spread as easily through a population where many individuals are immune. This is especially important for protecting vulnerable populations, such as infants, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, who may not be able to receive certain vaccines. By achieving herd immunity, we can prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect public health.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

can you cook an egg only using durect sunlight in any place of our solar system ? ASSISTANT: ,,"Yes, it is possible to cook an egg using direct sunlight in any place within our solar system as long as there is sufficient sunlight. The method you use to cook the egg would depend on the specific location and environment. In some places, you could simply place the egg on a surface that absorbs sunlight, such as a rock or a piece of metal, and let the sun heat it up. In other cases, you might need to use a solar cooker, which is a device designed to concentrate sunlight and convert it into heat for cooking.

However, it's worth noting that the speed at which an egg will cook using sunlight will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of the sunlight, the ambient temperature, and the size and shape of the egg. In some locations with very intense sunlight, such as close to the equator or in a desert, an egg might cook more quickly than in other locations with less intense sunlight. Additionally, the cooking time will also depend on the method you use to cook the egg and the materials you use to cook it, such as the type of solar cooker or the surface you use to place the egg on.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval

"Can you explain to me how the stable diffusion algorithm for ai generated images can be used to enhance the visual quality of low resolution and low quality images? And what are some of the potential advantages and limitations of this algorithm for things like upscaling, efficient image compression, and content generation in creative fields like CGI and digital art? ASSISTANT: ",,"The stable diffusion algorithm for AI-generated images is an advanced technique that uses deep learning models to improve the visual quality of low-resolution and low-quality images. It works by utilizing a combination of generative models, specifically denoising score matching and contrastive divergence, to create high-quality images that are more visually appealing and detailed.

Here's how it can be used to enhance low-resolution and low-quality images:

1. Denoising: The algorithm uses denoising score matching to distinguish between the true data distribution and the noisy one, focusing on recovering the original, high-quality image from the degraded version.
2. Upsampling: The algorithm can upscale low-resolution images by generating more pixels and filling in information that was lost due to compression or other factors.
3. Refining details: The generative models can be guided to create realistic textures, patterns, and other details, making the image appear more detailed and visually appealing.

Advantages of the stable diffusion algorithm:

1. Upscaling: The algorithm can significantly improve the quality of low-resolution images, making them suitable for high-resolution displays and other applications.
2. Efficient image compression: By leveraging the generative models, the algorithm can recover high-quality images from heavily compressed versions, potentially reducing storage and bandwidth requirements.
3. Content generation: In creative fields like CGI and digital art, this technique can be used to generate new, high-quality content or to enhance existing elements in a scene, improving the overall aesthetic of the final product.

Limitations of the stable diffusion algorithm:

1. Computational complexity: The algorithm requires a significant amount of computational power and time, making it potentially unsuitable for real-time applications or devices with limited resources.
2. Dependence on training data: The quality of the generated images largely depends on the quality and diversity of the training data used to train the generative models. If the training data is limited or biased, the algorithm may fail to produce satisfactory results or may introduce artifacts.
3. Difficulty in controlling output: Unlike some other generative models, the stable diffusion algorithm may not offer precise control over the generated output, making it challenging to achieve specific visual results in some cases.

Overall, the stable diffusion algorithm for AI-generated images presents many exciting opportunities for enhancing visual quality, upscaling, efficient image compression, and content generation in creative fields. However, it is essential to consider its limitations and challenges when evaluating its suitability for specific applications.",,reciprocate/alpaca-eval
